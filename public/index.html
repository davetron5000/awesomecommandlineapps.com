  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve spent the last year [writing a book][book] on building awesome command-line applications in Ruby.  Over the course of
writing it, I&#8221;ve used a lot of Ruby libraries for building command-line apps, and none of them work quite right.  In my book, I
spent significant time on [OptionParser][optparse], since it&#8217;s builtin, and [GLI][gli], since I wrote it.</p>

<p>I just finished up an appendix where I used [main][main], [thor][thor], and [trollop][trollop] to build my running examples in
the book.  I did this for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>These tools are popular, and people have asked if they&#8217;d be included</li>
<li>They are, by and large, very different from how OptionParser and GLI work</li>
<li>I wanted to give them a real shakedown</li>
</ul>


<p>I also surveyed many other tools, but, alas, I can&#8217;t include everything.  Each of these tools had common theme, which was to
avoid the boilerplate of OptionParser, and make it really easy to parse command-line arguments.  They all have done this at quite
a large cost.  All of them are less powerful and extensible than OptionParser, and only slightly more compact (or, in the case of
main, way less compact).</p>

<p>Enter [methadone][methadone], which I developed while working on the book and developing my [talk][gogaruco-talk] for Golden Gate
Ruby Conf 2011.</p>

<h2>Another command-line option parser?</h2>

<p>Yes and no.  Methadone isn&#8217;t a re-implementation of command-line option parsing.  It&#8217;s barely a DSL, making use of almost no
meta-programming. <code>class_eval</code>, or other craziness.  It&#8217;s a pure Ruby proxy to OptionParser, with some helper methods.  It makes
idiomatic and canonical option parsing and command-line app design as seemless as possible, but doesn&#8217;t force <em>any</em> of itself one
you.  In this post, I&#8217;ll derive its syntax while showing you the basics of how to structure a simple command-line app.  To dig
deeper, you&#8217;ll have to [buy the book][book] (but never fear, if you don&#8217;t like Methadone, it only takes up a few scant pages at
the end).</p>

<h2>Basic Command-line App Structure</h2>

<p>Most command-line apps start off with parsing the command-line with OptionParser (which typically consists of setting values into
some <code>Hash</code>), defining a few helper methods, and then, at the end, implementing the main logic of the program:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=naive_cli.rb" />

Yuck.  The boilerplate optino parsing is bad enough, but the structure is all wrong.  The interesting stuff is all the way at the bottom; you have to read the thing in the wrong order.  At the very least, you should use a main method:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=main_method.rb"></script>

Of course, we might raise an exception.  We might *want* to, but we certainly don&#8217;t want our app vomitinbg out a backtrace.
That&#8217;s amateur hour.  So, we wrap our call to `main`:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=wrapped_main.rb"></script>

## Methadone&#8217;s Main Method

We now have a pretty canonical structure for any simple command-line app.  We don&#8217;t want to include this every time, so we&#8217;ll use
the first feature of Methadone, which is the `main` method:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=main_methadone.rb"></script>

This does a few things for us.  `go!` will execute the contents of the block given to `main`.  It will extract the contents of
`ARGV` and pass them to the block, you don&#8217;t have to call `shift` a bunch of times.  Just name your parameters whatever, and
Metahdone takes care of it.   If your main block raises an exception,
     `go!` will handle catching it, messaging the user without a backtrace, and exiting nonzer.

## Parse Options with no Loss of Power

Of course, that option parsing code is still annoying, especially since we&#8217;re just setting it into an options hash.

Methadone&#8217;s `Main` module exposes some helper methods.  One of them is called `on`, and it works exactly like `OptionParser`&#8217;s
`on` method:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=methadone_on.rb"></script>

Methadone maintains an instance of `OptionParser`, and this will pass through to it.  That means that validations via list or
regex will work just fine.  Type conversions pass right on through; you can even add your own via `opts.accept`.

Of course, since we are almost always just taking
the flag argument and putting it into a `Hash`, Methadone takes care of that for us.  The following code is identical to the code
above:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=methadone_on_better.rb"></script>

This works because Methadone exposes a method `options`, which returns the `Hash` of the current options.  It&#8217;s available inside
our `main` block.  Of course, if we need to do something fancy, we can do anything that OptionParser can do, and if we set values
in `options`, they&#8217;ll stick.

## Do the Right Thing

Because we&#8217;re using OptionParser, we get all the benefits of the great help system that OptionParser provides.  A key part of
that system is the _banner_.  The banner tells the user what the program is for and how to invoke it.  OptionParser provides a
reasonable default, but it&#8217;s not good enough.   We want:

    $ awesome_app.rb &#8211;help
    Does so many awesome things, you won&#8217;t believe it.

    Usage:  awesome_app.rb [options] thing other_thing [optional_thing]

We can make this with a big, fat string, but why should we?  Methadone knows that our app takes options, and it knows the name of
our app, so let&#8217;s just tell it the missing information:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=banner.rb"></script>

Not only will Methadone automatically create your banner, but it will complain if the first two, required, arguments are missing.
Don&#8217;t like that?  Just call `banner=` and set the banner to whatever you want.  Methadone doesn&#8217;t care.  It&#8217;s just there to help.

Methadone makes it dead simple to write only what you need to, but doesn&#8217;t stop you from unleashing the full power of
OptionParser, or doing things a different way, if you like.

## Sweet, Sweet Sugar

But wait!  There&#8217;s more!  Complex programs start to look like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=cheesy.rb"></script>

You&#8217;ve got a mix of commented-out debug statements, informational messages and teadiously long error messages going to the
standard error.  Methadone includes a special `Logger` instance that does away with all this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=logger.rb"></script>

By defuault, `debug` messages don&#8217;t go anywhere.  `info` goes to the standard output and
`warn`, `error`, and `fatal` go to the standard error.  Theses messages are _unformatted_ and ready for consumption by the user.
Messags automatically go to the right stream.  Of course, if you redirect either of these to a file, you get full, complete
timestamped log messages.  Perfect for use in cron.

## Even this is too much to type

    $ methadone my_app

This generates a gemified project, complete with a README, Rakefile, unit tests and an [aruba][aruba]-powered cucumber test, so
you can TDD your app instantly.  Your `bin` file will be setup with Methadone&#8217;s structure and you&#8217;re off to the races.  It even
comes with some add-ons to Aruba to let you test-drive your user interface.

## Will there be more?

Of course!  Methadone&#8217;s still in a pre-release state right now, although it&#8217;s being used in production.  The parts that are there
are solid, completely tested and good to go.  I just want to add some more sugar before calling it V1.  Namely, I want to make it
easy to write shell scripts in Ruby.  Something like `FileUtils` but better.

<h3>Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby</h3>

<h4>Control your Computer, Simplify your Life</h4>

<p>Woot!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.awesomecommandlineapps.com/">My Book</a> is in Beta!  Whoohoo!  It&#8217;s all about writing amazing command-line apps in Ruby.  This isn&#8217;t about hacking
together UNIX commands, or bash scripting…this is about making apps that are easy to learn, easy to use, easy to write, and
that will delight their users.  Seriously, stop making crappy command-line scripts, read my book, and start kicking ass.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a <strong>long</strong> time coming.  Please stop now, and go <a href="http://www.awesomecommandlineapps.com/">check it out</a>.  I started this almost a year ago during
<a href="http://forums.pragprog.com/forums/190">PragProWriMo</a>, where I wrote (almost) every single day in November of 2010.  When I saw that <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/">Travis
Swicegood</a> (one of the few who made it all the way through) had gotten his manuscript accepted, I cleaned up a chapter
and submitted and the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com">Prags</a> accepted!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent my time since then writing, re-writing, re-organizing, and working hard to get this thing done.  It&#8217;s in beta,
meaning that you can buy the e-book and read the work in progress.  It&#8217;s <em>almost</em> complete, just a few chapters to go, and by
reading it in beta, you can give me valuable feedback to make the book even better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve always liked superhero stuff, but was never into comics as a kid.
Reading Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashpoint_(comics)">summaries</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Crisis">insanity</a> that is the DC universe&#8217;s continuity makes me never want to touch the stuff.  Now, it seems, they&#8217;ve thrown all of that out and started things fresh.  Though it&#8217;s not a reboot.  Whatever.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/files/2011/07/Justice-League-12-150x150.jpg"></p>

<p>Having zero desire to locate, much less visit, my local comics store, the awesome <a href="http://www.comixology.com/">Comixology</a> app is
my gateway to nerdom.  I&#8217;ve used it to read a few  short-run titles like Kick-Ass and Wanted, and they carry the DC titles.
<strong>And</strong>, the New 52 titles are being released digitally at the same time as they are in print.  Awesome.  Nothing more annoying
than downloading some 5 year old comic that just abruptly ends because they didn&#8217;t feel like digitizing all of it.</p>

<p>Based on what I know about the characters, and a few recommendations, I got the #1&#8217;s for several of the new titles:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Action Comics</em> - Superman&#8217;s young and pissed, and Lex Luthor is out to get him.  Love this one.  And, I&#8217;m cool with his costume being jeans and a T-shirt.</li>
<li><em>All Star Western</em> - Jonah Hex is a kick-ass dude in 1800s Gotham City.  I like the vibe, but the story seemed a bit formulaic,
and I&#8217;m not sure I care about yet another grumpy badass character.  I&#8217;ll read #2 and see if it picks up.</li>
<li><em>Batman</em> - YES.  So very good.  The first two issues deal with some shadowy assasins coming to Gotham and Batman is ready to
kick some serious ass.</li>
<li><em>Batwoman</em> - No clue who or what Batwoman is supposed to be.  I bought the first two issues based on a recommendation and I
probably won&#8217;t continue.  Story is kinda boring and the character just doesn&#8217;t interest me.  Plus, it seems the bad guys are
stupid supernatural demons or something, and I just hate that stuff.</li>
<li><em>Catwoman</em> - Dumb fun.  This one&#8217;s been getting flak for it&#8217;s overt sexuality, but I love the idea of a character who&#8217;s in it
for herself and not trying to be a hero.  The scene in the second issue with Bruce acting like a drunken idiot while watching
Selina&#8217;s every move is awesome.  Definitely keep reading this one.</li>
<li><em>Detective Comics</em> - I dont even remember what this one&#8217;s about.  Batman plus blood-n-guts.  I dunno.  Wasn&#8217;t really into it,
and <em>Batman</em> is just way better so far.</li>
<li><em>Justice League</em> - Love it.  The League hasn&#8217;t formed, no one knows each other <em>or</em> trusts each other and the government&#8217;s out
to get all the heros.  And Darkseid is sending bombs and dudes to Earth.  Green Lantern: &#8220;You&#8217;re not just some guy in a bat
costume are you?&#8221;.  Ha!</li>
<li><em>Wonder Woman</em> - REALLY boring.  No idea what the story is, but there&#8217;s centaurs and Zeus and other boring shit I can&#8217;t stand.</li>
</ul>


<p>The rest of the new 52 titles don&#8217;t look super interesting to me; I think a lot of the Justice League characters are kinda boring
on their own, with Superman and Batman being the exception.  The other &#8220;Bat family&#8221; titles look OK, but I&#8217;m pretty happy with
what I&#8217;ve got for the time being.</p>

<p>The only thing I don&#8217;t get how all this fits together; Batman&#8217;s in three of the titles I&#8217;m reading, and so is it the same guy at
different points, or totally different stories that are timeless or what?  Ah well.</p>

<time datetime="2011-08-07T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 7<span>th</span>, 2011</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Museums aren&#8217;t the only things curated anymore - now, everything is!</p>

<p>If there were a &#8220;trending word&#8221; of the decade leading up to this one, it would be &#8220;curated&#8221;.  Although I&#8217;d heard the word before its launch, the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/en/genre/mobile-software-applications/id36?mt=8">iOS App Store</a> certainly brought it to the forefront of everyone interested in technology.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s a concept that&#8217;s been around forever.  I posted this picture on <a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a> a few months ago titled &#8220;A study in
usability&#8221;:</p>

<p><img src="/images/bar_aid.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is a device my wife got from her dad that allows you to &#8220;look up&#8221; the recipe for about 80 different cocktails.  You find the
one you want on the front, and turn a dial, which reveals the recipe in the small window in the center.  Old school and retro, it
adds some nostalgia to our home bar setup.</p>

<p>Compare this to a book of cocktail recipes I&#8217;ve had for quite sometime:</p>

<p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cBoKhQN2L._BO2,204,203,35,-76_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg" /></p>

<p>It has hundreds, if not <strong>thousands</strong> of cocktail recipes.  It is, in every way, far superior to the Bar Aid, right?  It has more
recipes, it has several indeces, and it has plenty of space to describe how to make the cocktail in question.</p>

<p>The Bar Aid is actualy <em>much</em> more usable, and gets a lot more use when I&#8217;m at the bar.  Why?</p>

<p>Curation.</p>

<p>The Bar Aid is, for all intents and purposes, a <em>curated</em> list of cocktails.  It&#8217;s not only a list of 80 popular and common
cocktails, but it&#8217;s also a list of 80 cocktails whose recipe fits in a 5&#8221;x1&#8221; window.  Common and simple.  It has never steered me
wrong.</p>

<p>What if I want a cocktail not on the list, or if I have a strange ingredient and want to see what cocktails I can make with it?
Do I reach for the &#8220;Ultimate A-Z Bar Guide&#8221;?  Not often.  I usually reach for the Internet (yes <a href="/blog/2011/08/01/why-i-wont-work-for-google-twitter-facebook.html">Google</a>).   The <em>Internet</em> is
my new reference guide.  It has <strong>more</strong> information and choices than any reference I have at home, and is <em>infinitely</em> searchable.</p>

<p>In this modern age we live in, references, like the A-Z Guide, are useless when compared to the Internet. They&#8217;re also useless compared to curated material like the Bar Aid.  When I want to look up a &#8220;good cocktail&#8221;, I can quickly flip through the Bar Aid and find something easy to make.  When I need something more involved, I&#8217;ll hit Google.</p>

<p>I find this fascinating and I think it&#8217;s a big problem for creators of reference materials of any kind.  I don&#8217;t need 100 of Gordon Ramsay&#8217;s best dishes, I need his 20 best starters.  I don&#8217;t want to know how Roger Ebert rated every movie of the last century, but I&#8217;d love to know his 10 best straight-to-video releases.</p>

<p>I think this is a <em>great</em> way for those knowledgable on something to spread that knowledge and create interest in their field.  Focused, curated information is going to continue to be important.  It&#8217;s just too hard to search the Internet when you only want &#8220;something good&#8221;, and a reference book is too limiting when you want to hunt down something specific.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;m a huge nerd who recently spent a few hours in <a href="http://groundkontrol.com/">Ground Kontrol</a>, I&#8217;ll leave you with my curated list of
80s video games that are the easiest and most fun to play:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Centipede</strong> - fast, great sound FX, lots of shooting</li>
<li><strong>Frogger</strong> - great music, colorful, easy to grok, hard to master</li>
<li><strong>Ms. Pac Man</strong> - AMAZING sound, nonviolent, rewarding</li>
<li><strong>Star Wars (the vector one)</strong> - vector graphics are so great, sound design and music is wonderful, and the controls are natural and fun</li>
<li><strong>Super Sprint</strong> - fast-paced car racing that&#8217;s <em>just</em> realistic enough to be challenging, but not so much that you&#8217;re bored</li>
<li><strong>Tempest</strong> - abstract vector graphics and premise; just shoot things with satisfying sound effects</li>
<li><strong>Tron</strong> - four awesome games in one; you get to <em>be</em> the light cycle, fight tanks, and kill that pesky MCP.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just got back from OSCON 2011.  There were some really interesting talks, and “the big three” were all over the place: Google, Twitter, and Facebook.  I attended the <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/20528">Twitter talk</a> on how they moved from Ruby to the JVM, as well a talk by Rob Pike (of Google) on <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18653">Go</a>.  I use Twitter and Google a <em>lot</em>, and enjoyed hearing about how they work (Facebook, on the other hand, I use begrudgingly).</p>

<p>My first reaction to these talks was “Wow, it sure sounds like a lot of fun to work at these places!” From inventing programming languages to using Scala to scale a massive architecture, it sounds like developer shangri-la.  Until recently, I was slinging <a href="/blog/2010/01/09/Top-5-Omissions-From-Spring-MVC.html">Spring MVC</a> code in vanilla Java.  Sucks for me, right?</p>

<p>This is lazy thinking, and I haven&#8217;t fallen victim to it in quite a while.  Ask yourself: “Why would Google spend the time and money to get Rob Pike to work for them and invent an entirely new programming language?”  Ask: “Why would Twitter spend the time and money to design and deploy an elegant, scalable architecture using the JVM and Scala?”</p>

<p>An awesome new programming language, or an impressive, scalable architecture is not an end to itself.  These are tools that serve some other purpose.</p>

<p>In the case of Google, Twitter, and Facebook, that purpose is to serve ads.</p>

<p>Although <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKmQW_Nkfk8">Steve Yegge&#8217;s</a> keynote features him “quitting” his project at Google (which he describes as “sharing cat pictures”) to work on some higher calling (still within Google), he&#8217;s just trading one ad-serving system for another.</p>

<p>Google+ isn&#8217;t about sharing cat pictures, it&#8217;s about serving ads.  Twitter&#8217;s massive network of 140-character bits of information isn&#8217;t about connecting people across the globe or to view current trends in worldwide thinking, it&#8217;s about serving ads.  Facebook isn&#8217;t about entertaining yourself with games or sharing interesting links, it&#8217;s about serving ads.</p>

<p>So, why are the best and brightest in the industry busting their asses to work at these places?   If all you care about is watching performance metrics increase, or playing with something new, or just watching lots of tests pass, I guess it&#8217;s nice to get paid well.  But, how can this be truly fulfilling?  For me, it wouldn&#8217;t be.  I need the tools I&#8217;m building, the products I work on, and the architecture I&#8217;m helping to create to all serve something I&#8217;m interested in.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying that my code needs to save the world or support humanitarian causes, but it should at least be something that <em>I</em> like, or <em>I</em> would use, or that <em>I</em> care about.</p>

<p>And I can&#8217;t fucking abide advertisements.  Honestly, I don&#8217;t know anyone who does.  Except, apparently, a lot of really smart software engineers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Co-worker sent out an email today, letting everyone know about a handy Mac app called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cdto/">cdto</a>.  You drag it to Finder and, if you
click it, it will open a Terminal window where the current working directory is the folder you&#8217;re viewing in Finder.  Pretty handy.</p>

<p>I click the link and get to a Google Code page, with a link to a zip.  Then, I thought, maybe the developer is being nice and has put
it in the App Store; that way, I can install it here with one click, and install it at home with one click.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>But, <em>another</em> developer has created a similar app called <a href="http://inscopeapps.com/#shellto">ShellTo</a>.  The icon is similar, and it does exactly the same
thing.  However, it&#8217;s 99 cents.</p>

<p>Now, I have a bit of a dilemma.  Do I download cdto, find the expanded folder (called “cdto dist”) in my
Downloads folder, search that for the executable (there were several directories, only one having the app),
drag it to the Applications folder and then repeat the process (which I can make <em>slightly</em> faster via Dropbox) at home?</p>

<p>Or, do I pay a buck to have this done instantly and painlessly?</p>

<p>I paid the buck.</p>

<p>If you could pay a dollar for 5 minutes of your time back, would you?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>You don&#8217;t need schedule time to play video games</p><footer><strong>Merlin Mann</strong> <cite>Back to Work</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/">Merlin Mann</a> has said this more than a few times on his great <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">podcast</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/danbenjamin">Dan Benjamin</a>, and it
really strikes a chord with me.  Not that I play video games (I don&#8217;t), but the underyling message really speaks to me: “you don&#8217;t need to schedule time to do
things you <em>really</em> want to do.”</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true; I don&#8217;t have any problem finding time throughout the week to work on my book, or hack on <a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/gli">open source</a> stuff, or have a
great meal with my lovely <a href="http://twitter.com/amymaura">fiancé</a>.  What I <em>do</em> have a problem finding time for are the things I hate doing, but that I feel,
intellecutally, that I <em>should</em> be doing.</p>

<p>Given that, in less than two months, I&#8217;ll be on a beach in Puerto Rico, getting married, and having my picture taken, I started to get
worried.  I&#8217;m not obese, but I&#8217;m far from a healthy weight, and I lead a mostly sedentary lifestyle.  I also rarely eat breakfast, leading
me to just devour massive amounts of food at lunchtime.</p>

<p>About once a month, I&#8217;ll “buckle down” and make breakfast about twice, and make it to the gym a few times, and the back to normal.</p>

<p>Not this time.  Other than a life-long partner, the <em>other</em> thing from a wedding that lasts are the pictures.  And, if I can&#8217;t get myself in
some semblance of shape for <em>that</em>, well…I just can&#8217;t do it.  And I hate not being able to do things.</p>

<h2>Doing the things I hate</h2>

<p>My problem was this constant feeling of “not enough time in the day.”  We seem to have solved this problem <a href="http://www.heyitsopower.com">at work</a>, and that&#8217;s
<em>way</em> more complex than my life.</p>

<p>So, I started with a completely empty day, and started to carve things out, one by one.</p>

<p>I wanted to leave work at 6pm every day. That means
getting there by 9:30am.  And if I want to go to the gym, I&#8217;d need to be <em>done</em> working out by 9:00am.  I worked all the way through
everything I&#8217;d need to do, including making breakfast and packing my bag the night before.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hyperschedule.png" title="'My Hyperschedule'" ></p>

<p>As you can see, I&#8217;ve scheduled things down to the minute: I get up at 6:50, start making breakfast by 7, and clean it all up in time to
leave for the gym by 7:35.  I set each of these to loudly alarm on my iPhone, so I keep the right pace.</p>

<p>And yes, I also planned when to eat
lunch and what to have (I eat at one of the same three restaurants every day anyway, why bother having to make the decision?).</p>

<h2>Does it work?</h2>

<p>So far, it has <em>totally</em> worked.  I&#8217;ve <em>never, ever</em> in my life made it to the gym more than twice in one week.  EVER.  The first three
weeks, I made it 4 times each week, and did 30 minutes of cardio, plus stretches, weights, etc.  I was also in bed by 11:00 each night, with
my bag packed and ready to go.</p>

<p>And then I got food poisoning, forcing an entire week of <em>not</em> following this schedule.</p>

<p>I was really worried I&#8217;d lost all my momentum, that maybe the
“newness” of this technique would wear off.</p>

<h3>I started right back up</h3>

<p>Not a problem; started back into my routine with no problems at all.  Now, I&#8217;m not tracking calories, weight, or anything (this can&#8217;t be about manipulating metrics, it has to be about establishing a healthy routine), but so far, I think this has the highest chance of working its way into my life.</p>

<h2>Why does this work?</h2>

<p>When I&#8217;d make it to the gym, I&#8217;d feel rushed.  “Shit, I have to hurry, so I can get to work in time to put in the right hours so I can get
home and then do fun stuff!”  “I won&#8217;t go to the gym, because I overslept and I won&#8217;t get a proper workout, so why bother?”  The excuses
went on and on.</p>

<p>Now that everything&#8217;s scheduled, I&#8217;m not rushed.  I never worry that I&#8217;ll miss out on anything, because all of my “chores” are accounted
for: getting up in time to make a proper breakfast, getting to the gym in time to get a proper work out, getting to work in time to put in
my hours <em>and</em> leave at a reasonable hour, etc.</p>

<p>Getting ready the night before is also crucial: it reduces friction for the next day, and also represents a commitment to myself.  If I&#8217;ve
already gone to the trouble of packing up my clothes and stuff for the gym, when I&#8217;m groggy the next morning, trying to convince myself to
sleep more, I think about that bag: “Well, I&#8217;m actually all ready, so I might as well actually go.”</p>

<h3>What about scheduling “free time?”</h3>

<p>I decided to explicitly <em>not</em> schedule “free” activities.  There&#8217;s nothing on my calendar that says “work on book” or “make dinner” or
“watch TV with fiancé.”  As Merlin says, these don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to be scheduled, and, honestly, free time doesn&#8217;t feel free when the iPhone alarams are going off.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s next?</h2>

<p>Keep doing it and hope my wedding pictures turn out great!  I&#8217;ll report back after the honeymoon with the results!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At <a href="http://www.rubynation.org">RubyNation</a>, I gave a talk on <a href="http://awesome-cli-ruby.heroku.com">Making Awesome Command Line Applications in Ruby</a>, which I&#8217;ve done a few times, and is what led to my currently-in-progress book on the subject.</p>

<p>One of the assertions I added to the talk, based on my work on the book is the specific advice to not start off in bash…use Ruby.  This was questioned by a member of the audience (who I realized later was <a href="http://twitter.com/bmizerany">Blake Mizerany</a> of Heroku/Sinatra fame, i.e. someone far more knowledgable than me about CLI apps, Ruby, and shell programming).</p>

<p>My answer was about as eloquent as a middle-school debate team closing argument and amounted to “Me hate bash.”</p>

<p>Although I <em>do</em> dislike shell programming, it&#8217;s not exactly fair of me to transfer my personal preferences into solid “advice,” nor is it fair to imply that shell programming is a lame or worthless skill; it&#8217;s certainly not.</p>

<p>So, I thought about it a bit more and I have a <em>real</em> answer to the question “Why use Ruby instead of shell?”</p>

<p>Blake made the point that one of my examples (in Ruby) would&#8217;ve been very trivial in shell, and further that issues I was discussing could be easily avoided by simply better-wielding the shell.  His preference was to convert to Ruby only when things got complicated.</p>

<p>I would generally agree, for some definition of “when things get complicated.”</p>

<p>For me, things get complicated in shell <em>very</em> quickly…I&#8217;m just not a shell expert and likely won&#8217;t ever be.  A lot of developers aren&#8217;t shell experts, and are not going to be able to use the shell programming language <em>nearly</em> as effectively as they could Ruby.</p>

<p>So, rather than write <em>bad</em> shell code and then port to Ruby later (once you&#8217;ve made a mess), my advice, assuming you aren&#8217;t a shell expert and aren&#8217;t looking to become one, is to just start off with Ruby.</p>

<p>I say this because the average developer is much more likely to be able to write clean &amp; idiomatic Ruby code than to write similarly idiomatic shell code.</p>

<p>That said, I probably should become <em>more</em> of an expert on shell programming and would love some resources if anyone has any.</p>

<time datetime="2011-01-10T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 10<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Jan 3, I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/davetron5000/status/21943399506509824">tweeted</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>All personal stuff only on iPad; no twitter, email, or RSS on work computer. Will it keep me more focused?</p></blockquote>

<p>Essentially, what I decided to try doing was to bring my iPad to work every day, and use it for Twitter, RSS, and personal emails.  The only &#8220;personal&#8221; stuff I would be doing on my work machine would be IM, simply because the IM experience on iPad is not very good, and the immediacy of it would be lost on a computer that&#8217;s not right in front of me.  I don&#8217;t do a lot of personal IM&#8217;ing anyway, so this seemed like a good compromise.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Normally, I get all kinds of notifications on my machine: new emails, new stories in RSS, new tweets, etc.  This divides my focus.  I&#8217;ll spend upwards of five minutes reading mail or blogs while waiting for a <em>two</em> minute test run to complete.  Not good.  It&#8217;s hard enough to focus where I work as it is, so I thought this would help.  Further, when I <em>do</em> take a break and focus on RSS or personal email, I&#8217;m bombarded with work-related things&hellip;the very things I&#8217;m trying to take a break from!</p>

<h2>How did it go?</h2>

<p>In a word: &#8220;smashing.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tended to keep Twitter for iPad running, as that&#8217;s pretty easy to duck in and out of.  <em>Any</em> interesting link, I sent right to <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> for reading on the train home.  I only read RSS feeds a couple times a day, usually during lunch, and during the dreaded 3pm doldrums where I just start fading and need a break.</p>

<p>I got to most personal emails I would normally deal with, however, because of the iPad&#8217;s virtual keyboard, I pushed off dealing with emails that required a bit more writing.  This turns out to be a good thing, because most of the time these sorts of emails can just wait until I get home.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to keep it going as long as I can; I think it&#8217;s going to be a great way to maintain focus without just ditching the handy notification systems that are useful throughout the day.  When I&#8217;m working, I&#8217;m not thinking about personal email or what&#8217;s been posted to Daring Fireball.  When I&#8217;m taking a break, I&#8217;m just dealing with email, taking in blog entries and <em>actually</em> recharging for the next block of work.</p>

<p>I <em>don&#8217;t</em> think this would be possible on just a phone; the iPad provides a near-to-a-real-computer enough experience that I can do just about everything I need to on it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, while waiting for guests to arrive at my mostly-annual New Year&#8217;s Eve party, I found a txt file I created called <code>2010_goals.txt</code>.  It&#8217;s contents:</p>

<ul>
<li>speak at at least one more user&#8217;s group</li>
<li>speak at some sort of conference</li>
<li>deploy an App to the iPhone App Store</li>
<li>Deploy a Rails 2 app to Heroku</li>
</ul>


<p>I had totally forgotten about this, although I accomplished almost everything on that list.  This year, I spoke at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/">DCRUG</a> twice, <a href="http://www.novajug.org/">NOVAJUG</a> once, and <a href="http://naildrivin5.com/blog/2010/04/30/my-talk-at-scala-days.html">spoke at ScalaDays</a> 2010 in Switzerland (and was subsequently trapped by that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull">stupid volcano</a>) as well as <a href="http://www.lonestarrubyconf.com/">Lone Star Ruby Conf</a> in Austin.  While I still haven&#8217;t quite submitted <a href="http://naildrivin5.com/blog/2010/07/18/iphone-app-part-5.html">my iPhone app</a> to the app store, I <em>did</em> deploy a Rails <em>three</em> app to heroku, namely my Rails Rumble &#8216;10 entry <a href="http://carltherobot.heroku.com">Carl The Robot</a>.   On top of all that, I successfully completed <a href="http://forums.pragprog.com/forums/190">PragProWriMo</a>, writing a 170+ page book on command-line applications in Ruby in just one month.  <em>And</em> had <a href="http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/3737">more</a> <a href="http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/3750">than</a> <a href="http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/3751">a few</a> <a href="http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/3793">patches</a> <a href="http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/4021">accepted</a> <a href="https://github.com/schacon/showoff/commit/b43fab03cd618335ad8d7c1774ff607d433d4321">to some</a> <a href="http://scala-lang.org">open source</a> <a href="https://github.com/schacon/showoff">projects</a>.</p>

<p>So, I created <code>2011_goals.txt</code> to continue the tradition:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deploy my iPhone app to App Store</li>
<li>Speak at at least 2 conferences</li>
<li>Publish my command-line application book</li>
<li>Develop and deploy an iPad app</li>
<li>Blog twice a month</li>
<li>Learn JavaScript more betterer</li>
<li>Get my rudimentary <a href="http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/4102">scaladoc doclet</a> accepted.</li>
</ul>


<p>I think it&#8217;s doable, but I&#8217;ve got a busy year planned in the non-geek-related parts of my life, so who knows?  What are <em>your</em> goals for 2011?</p>
