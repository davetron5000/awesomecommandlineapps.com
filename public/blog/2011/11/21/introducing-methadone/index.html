<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve spent the last year [writing a book][book] on building awesome command-line applications in Ruby.  Over the course of
writing it, I&#8221;ve used a lot of Ruby libraries for building command-line apps, and none of them work quite right.  In my book, I
spent significant time on [OptionParser][optparse], since it&#8217;s builtin, and [GLI][gli], since I wrote it.</p>

<p>I just finished up an appendix where I used [main][main], [thor][thor], and [trollop][trollop] to build my running examples in
the book.  I did this for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>These tools are popular, and people have asked if they&#8217;d be included</li>
<li>They are, by and large, very different from how OptionParser and GLI work</li>
<li>I wanted to give them a real shakedown</li>
</ul>


<p>I also surveyed many other tools, but, alas, I can&#8217;t include everything.  Each of these tools had common theme, which was to
avoid the boilerplate of OptionParser, and make it really easy to parse command-line arguments.  They all have done this at quite
a large cost.  All of them are less powerful and extensible than OptionParser, and only slightly more compact (or, in the case of
main, way less compact).</p>

<p>Enter [methadone][methadone], which I developed while working on the book and developing my [talk][gogaruco-talk] for Golden Gate
Ruby Conf 2011.</p>

<h2>Another command-line option parser?</h2>

<p>Yes and no.  Methadone isn&#8217;t a re-implementation of command-line option parsing.  It&#8217;s barely a DSL, making use of almost no
meta-programming. <code>class_eval</code>, or other craziness.  It&#8217;s a pure Ruby proxy to OptionParser, with some helper methods.  It makes
idiomatic and canonical option parsing and command-line app design as seemless as possible, but doesn&#8217;t force <em>any</em> of itself one
you.  In this post, I&#8217;ll derive its syntax while showing you the basics of how to structure a simple command-line app.  To dig
deeper, you&#8217;ll have to [buy the book][book] (but never fear, if you don&#8217;t like Methadone, it only takes up a few scant pages at
the end).</p>

<h2>Basic Command-line App Structure</h2>

<p>Most command-line apps start off with parsing the command-line with OptionParser (which typically consists of setting values into
some <code>Hash</code>), defining a few helper methods, and then, at the end, implementing the main logic of the program:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=naive_cli.rb" />

Yuck.  The boilerplate optino parsing is bad enough, but the structure is all wrong.  The interesting stuff is all the way at the bottom; you have to read the thing in the wrong order.  At the very least, you should use a main method:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=main_method.rb"></script>

Of course, we might raise an exception.  We might *want* to, but we certainly don&#8217;t want our app vomitinbg out a backtrace.
That&#8217;s amateur hour.  So, we wrap our call to `main`:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=wrapped_main.rb"></script>

## Methadone&#8217;s Main Method

We now have a pretty canonical structure for any simple command-line app.  We don&#8217;t want to include this every time, so we&#8217;ll use
the first feature of Methadone, which is the `main` method:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=main_methadone.rb"></script>

This does a few things for us.  `go!` will execute the contents of the block given to `main`.  It will extract the contents of
`ARGV` and pass them to the block, you don&#8217;t have to call `shift` a bunch of times.  Just name your parameters whatever, and
Metahdone takes care of it.   If your main block raises an exception,
     `go!` will handle catching it, messaging the user without a backtrace, and exiting nonzer.

## Parse Options with no Loss of Power

Of course, that option parsing code is still annoying, especially since we&#8217;re just setting it into an options hash.

Methadone&#8217;s `Main` module exposes some helper methods.  One of them is called `on`, and it works exactly like `OptionParser`&#8217;s
`on` method:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=methadone_on.rb"></script>

Methadone maintains an instance of `OptionParser`, and this will pass through to it.  That means that validations via list or
regex will work just fine.  Type conversions pass right on through; you can even add your own via `opts.accept`.

Of course, since we are almost always just taking
the flag argument and putting it into a `Hash`, Methadone takes care of that for us.  The following code is identical to the code
above:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=methadone_on_better.rb"></script>

This works because Methadone exposes a method `options`, which returns the `Hash` of the current options.  It&#8217;s available inside
our `main` block.  Of course, if we need to do something fancy, we can do anything that OptionParser can do, and if we set values
in `options`, they&#8217;ll stick.

## Do the Right Thing

Because we&#8217;re using OptionParser, we get all the benefits of the great help system that OptionParser provides.  A key part of
that system is the _banner_.  The banner tells the user what the program is for and how to invoke it.  OptionParser provides a
reasonable default, but it&#8217;s not good enough.   We want:

    $ awesome_app.rb &#8211;help
    Does so many awesome things, you won&#8217;t believe it.

    Usage:  awesome_app.rb [options] thing other_thing [optional_thing]

We can make this with a big, fat string, but why should we?  Methadone knows that our app takes options, and it knows the name of
our app, so let&#8217;s just tell it the missing information:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=banner.rb"></script>

Not only will Methadone automatically create your banner, but it will complain if the first two, required, arguments are missing.
Don&#8217;t like that?  Just call `banner=` and set the banner to whatever you want.  Methadone doesn&#8217;t care.  It&#8217;s just there to help.

Methadone makes it dead simple to write only what you need to, but doesn&#8217;t stop you from unleashing the full power of
OptionParser, or doing things a different way, if you like.

## Sweet, Sweet Sugar

But wait!  There&#8217;s more!  Complex programs start to look like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=cheesy.rb"></script>

You&#8217;ve got a mix of commented-out debug statements, informational messages and teadiously long error messages going to the
standard error.  Methadone includes a special `Logger` instance that does away with all this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384855.js?file=logger.rb"></script>

By defuault, `debug` messages don&#8217;t go anywhere.  `info` goes to the standard output and
`warn`, `error`, and `fatal` go to the standard error.  Theses messages are _unformatted_ and ready for consumption by the user.
Messags automatically go to the right stream.  Of course, if you redirect either of these to a file, you get full, complete
timestamped log messages.  Perfect for use in cron.

## Even this is too much to type

    $ methadone my_app

This generates a gemified project, complete with a README, Rakefile, unit tests and an [aruba][aruba]-powered cucumber test, so
you can TDD your app instantly.  Your `bin` file will be setup with Methadone&#8217;s structure and you&#8217;re off to the races.  It even
comes with some add-ons to Aruba to let you test-drive your user interface.

## Will there be more?

Of course!  Methadone&#8217;s still in a pre-release state right now, although it&#8217;s being used in production.  The parts that are there
are solid, completely tested and good to go.  I just want to add some more sugar before calling it V1.  Namely, I want to make it
easy to write shell scripts in Ruby.  Something like `FileUtils` but better.
