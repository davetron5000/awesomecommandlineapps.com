  <div class="entry-content"><p>The best way to get started with Git <b>and</b> have a better experience at work if you have to use SVN is to use <tt>git svn</tt> as a client to Subversion.  You can take advantage of <a href="http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/">Git&#8217;s awesomeness</a> while not requiring your team or infrastructure to change immediately.
</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<tt>git svn clone -t tags -T trunk -b branches svn+ssh://your.svn.com/path/to/svn/root</tt>
(This may take a while for a large or old svn repo)
<h3>Working on Trunk</h3>
The initial clone should leave you on git&#8217;s <tt>master</tt> branch, which is connected to svn&#8217;s trunk.
<ol>
<li><tt>git svn rebase</tt> <i># Optional: only if you want to get work from svn; you don&#8217;t have to</i></li>
<li>Hack some code</li>
<li><tt>git add any new files you created.txt</tt></li>
<li><tt>git commit -a</tt></li>
<li>Repeat from step 2 until done</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sharing Your Changes</h3>
You will rebase your changes against&#8217;s SVN&#8217;s (this means git will pretend you made all your changes from SVN&#8217;s current HEAD, not the HEAD you started with [you do this to avoid conflicts and merges, which SVN cannot handle]).
<ol>
<li><tt>git svn rebase</tt></li>
<li><tt>git svn dcommit</tt></li>
</ol>
<h4>If you got Conflicts</h4>
<ol>
<li>Git will tell you about them, so go and resolve them</li>
<li>For each file you had to resolve, <tt>git add the_filename</tt>
<li><tt>git rebase &#8211;continue</tt></li>
<li>Repeat until done</li>
</ol>
<h3>Working with SVN&#8217;s branches</h3>
Suppose you need to do some work on a branch called <tt>1.3.x</tt> in your SVN repo:
<ol>
<li><tt>git svn fetch</tt> <i># This updates your local copy of remote branches</i></li>
<li><tt>git checkout 1.3.x</tt># This checks out a remote branch, which you shouldn&#8217;t work directly on</i></li>
<li><tt>git checkout -b 1.3.x-branch</tt> <i># This creates a local branch you can work on, based on the remote 1.3.x branch</i></li>
<li>Hack some code</li>
<li><tt>git add</tt> and <tt>git commit -a</tt> as needed</li>
<li>Follow same procedure as above for Sharing Your Changes.  Git will send your changes to the 1.3.x branch in SVN and not the trunk</li>
</ol>
<h3>Merging the Changes You Made</h3>
Due to the way git interacts with SVN, you shouldn&#8217;t automatically just merge your branch work onto the trunk.  This may create strange histories in SVN.
<h3>So What?</h3>
So, this isn&#8217;t buying you much more than you get with SVN.  Yes, when you <tt>git checkout 1.3.x-branch</tt> it&#8217;s lightning fast, and you can work offline.  Here&#8217;s a few things that happen to me all the time that would be difficult or impossible to do without Git.
<h4>Gotta Fix a Bug Real Quicklike</h4>
You are in the middle of working on a new feature and you need to to push out a bugfix in production code.  Your in-development code can&#8217;t be checked into trunk:
<ol>
<li><tt>git stash</tt></li>
<li><tt>git checkout production-branch-name</tt></li>
<li><tt>git checkout -b bugfix-xyz</tt></li>
<li>Fix bugs</li>
<li><tt>git commit -a</tt></li>
<li><tt>git svn dcommit</tt></li>
<li><tt>git checkout master</tt></li>
<li><tt>git stash apply</tt></li>
</ol>
You are now back where you started, without a fake revision just to hold your code and you didn&#8217;t have to go checkout the branch elsewhere.
<h4>Can&#8217;t commit to SVN due to a release</h4>
Often, teams restrict commit access to SVN while a release is being prepared.  If the team is releasing version 1.5 and I&#8217;m working on 1.6 features, there can be some period of time where I&#8217;m not supposed to commit, because the 1.5 release is being prepared and under feature freeze.
<ol>
<li><tt>git commit -a</tt></li>
<li>Continuing working</li>
</ol>
When feature freeze is over, then I&#8217;ll <tt>git svn dcommit</tt> to send my changes to the SVN server
<h4>Blocked on Feature X, Want to work on Feature Y</h4>
This happens to me quite frequently:  I&#8217;m slated to work on a few features that aren&#8217;t interdependent.  I start hacking away on Feature X and hit a roadblock and can&#8217;t continue working.  I&#8217;ve got a half-implemented feature and I can&#8217;t make any forward motion until a meeting next week.  Feature Y, on the other hand, is ready to go.  This requires some planning ahead:
<ol>
<li><tt>git checkout master</tt></li>
<li><tt>git checkout -b feature-X</tt></li>
<li>Work on Feature X</li>
<li><tt>git commit -a</tt> etc. as I work</li>
<li>Get blocked; meeting next week.  D&#8217;oh!</li>
<li><tt>git checkout master</tt></li>
<li><tt>git checkout -b feature-Y</tt></li>
<li>Work on Feature Y</li>
</ol>

At this point, X and Y are on two local branches and I can switch back and forth as needed.  Don&#8217;t underestimate how powerful this is, especially when you have certain features that are priorities, but can become blocked frequently.  I can now easily put aside Feature Y once I have my meeting and start back up on Feature X.  When I&#8217;m done, I <tt>git merge</tt> everything back to master and <tt>dcommit</tt> to SVN.
<h4>Type your log message, save it, realize you forgot to reference a bug ticket #</h4>
You have a bug tracker set up that links tickets and revisions; all you have to do is put the ticket # in your log message.  It&#8217;s a nice feature, but I forget to do it frequently.  As long as you haven&#8217;t done <tt>git svn dcommit</tt>, you can fix this:
<ol>
<li><tt>git commit &#8211;amend</tt></li>
</ol>
Your editor will pop up and you can change the log message!  Awesome.
<h3>Advanced Stuff</h3>

Once you get used to this, you will feel more comfortable doing some more advanced things.  

<h4>Topic Branches</h4>
The most obviously beneficial was touched on above, but it boils down to: <b>make every new feature on its own branch</b>.  This means you <b>never work on master</b> and you <b>never work on an SVN branch</b>.  Those are only for assembling what you will send to SVN.  This gives incredible flexibility to work on code when its convenient and not worry about checking in bad things.  Git calls this <i>topic branches</i>.

<h4>Save your Experiments</h4>
If you do everything on a branch, you don&#8217;t have to delete your work, ever.  You can go back and revisit experiments, or work on low-priority features over a long period of time with all the advantages of version control, but without the baggage of remote branches you have to share with the world.

<h4>Cherry Pick</h4>
With Git, you typically commit frequently and you restrict the scope of each revision.  A commit in git is more like a checkpoint, and a push in  Git is more like a commit in SVN.  So, commit in git like crazy.  What this lets you do is move diffs around.  On several occasions, I&#8217;ve had some code on a branch that I needed to use, but didn&#8217;t want to pull in the entire branch.  <tt>git cherry-pick</tt> lets me do that.

<h4>Mindlessly Backup Your Repo</h4>

<ol>
<li><tt>ssh your_user@some.other.box.com</tt></li>
<li><tt>mkdir awesome_project</tt></li>
<li><tt>cd awesome_project</tt></li>
<li><tt>git init</tt></li>
<li><tt>exit</tt></li>
<li><tt>git remote add other-box your_user@some.other.box.com:/home/chrisb/awesome_project</tt></li>
<li><tt>git push &#8211;all other-box</tt></li>
<li><tt>echo &#8220;git push &#8211;force &#8211;all other-box&#8221; > .git/hooks/post-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit</tt></li>
</ol>
You now will back up your repository on every commit to the other box.  Or, use <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With regard to <a href="http://www.jroller.com/Solomon/entry/the_road_to_real_rest">this blog on REST compliance</a>
<p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Thank GODS that REST doesn&#8217;t have a spec.  If it did, it would still be in development.

<p>
P.S. If you are going to coin a term and you want to <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">bitch about it being misused</a>, maybe calling it a &#8220;style&#8221; isn&#8217;t the best idea.

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2009-03-11T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 11<span>th</span>, 2009</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the beginning, EJB was a bloated mess of XML configuration files that allowed some sort of ultimate flexibility that absolutely no one needed nor cared about.  And it sucked.  So developers started using conventions to keep track of the four classes required to make a remote method call, and XDoclet was created to automate the creation of the XML configuration files.  And it sucked less.  Following in EJB&#8217;s footsteps, Hibernate did the same thing.  And XDoclet followed.  And it still sucked. 
</p>
<p>
So, annotations were created to essentially formalize what XDoclet was doing, instead of considering how horribly broken the implementation of J2EE or Hibernate was.  And now that we have annotations, the &#8220;implementation pattern&#8221; of &#8220;ultimate flexibility through annotations&#8221; has made its way into numerous Java frameworks, such as JAX-RS and JPA.</p>
<p>
Regarding JPA:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='java'>@Id
@GeneratedValue
@Column(name=&quot;person_id&quot;)
public int getPersonId() { return personId; }</code>
  </pre>
</div>

This is not a significant improvement over XDoclet; the only benefit is if you mistype &#8220;GeneratedValue&#8221;, the compiler will catch it.  I shouldn&#8217;t have to type &#8220;GeneratedValue&#8221; in the first place.  Unless I&#8217;m doing something non-standard.  Which I almost never do.
</p>
<p>
I have a <tt>Person</tt> class with a <tt>getPersonId</tt> method.  Can JPA just assume that it maps to the <tt>PERSON</tt> table, and the <tt>PERSON_ID</tt>, respectively.  Further, couldn&#8217;t it figure out that it&#8217;s the auto-generated primary key since the schema says <tt>primary key auto increment</tt>.  All the information is there and available to the framework to figure this out.
</p>
<p>
The same goes for EJB.  I have a class named <tt>FooStatelessBean</tt>.  How about we assume it&#8217;s a stateless session bean, and it&#8217;s interface is defined by its public methods?  It can then provide <tt>FooRemote</tt> and <tt>FooLocal</tt> for me, and I don&#8217;t need to configure anything or keep three classes in sync.
</p>
<p>
Just because Java doesn&#8217;t have all the Ruby dynamic magic doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t make things easy.  In reading <a href="http://www.suryasuravarapu.com/2009/03/rest-crud-with-jax-rs-jersey.html">Surya Suravarapu’s blog post about CRUD via JAX-RS</a> I can&#8217;t help wondering why it takes so much code to call a few methods on a class?
</p>
<p>
Did the designers of JAX-RS not even <b>look</b> at how Rails does things?  I get a <tt>PUT</tt> to the url <tt>/customers/45</tt>.  We should default to calling <tt>put(45)</tt> on the class <tt>CustomersResource</tt>.  Only if I want to obfuscate what&#8217;s going (e.g. by having <tt>FooBar.frobnosticate()</tt> handle the request) should I be required to provide configuration.</p>
<p>Even in Surya&#8217;s example code, he&#8217;s following some conventions: His resource class is suffixed with <tt>Resource</tt> and his <tt>POST</tt> method is prefixed <tt>add</tt>.  This should be baked into the spec.  It&#8217;s like EJB all over again with the common conventions that aren&#8217;t supported by the framework because of too much useless flexibilty.
</p>
<p>
Supporting convention over configuration is easy in Java.  In just a few hours, <a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/fwf/tree/master">I had a tiny web framework</a> that proves it<sup>1</sup>.  It wouldn&#8217;t take much more effort to allow the default behavior to be overridden, but, unlike JAX-RS, EJB, or even the Servlet spec itself, it doesn&#8217;t punish developers who follow conventions.  It makes their lives easier and thus encourages good behavior.
</p>
<p>
So, the point of all this is that annotations encourage bad framework design; unnecessary configuration is a major part of many Java frameworks and specs.  And I have no idea why.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<i><sup>1</sup>it unfortunately breaks down at the UI layer, due to a statically typed and compiled language not being a great choice for implementing web UIs, but that&#8217;s another issue.</i>

  <div class="entry-content">While working on my <a href="http://davetron5000.github.com/gliffy">Gliffy Ruby Client</a>, I decided I wanted a better way to describe the command line interface.  Finding nothing that was any good, I whipped up <a href="http://davetron5000.github.com/gli">GLI</a> and refactored my Giffy command line client to use it.  While doing <b>that</b>, I finally got annoyed at <a href="http://github.com/technoweenie">technoweenie&#8217;s</a> version of rest-client, and also noticed that <a href="http://github.com/adamwiggins/rest-client/tree/master">the original author&#8217;s</a> had totally changed interfaces.  So, clicked the nice &#8220;Fork&#8221; button on GitHub to get my own copy and fixed the issues.  But that&#8217;s not the cool part.  The cool part is that I can change my Gliffy gem to depend on <b>my</b> rest-client implementation and, viola!  No special instructions, no hacks, no nothing.  This is a really cool thing that would be difficult with Subversion, impossible without RubyGems, and downright painful without <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">A couple interesting things happened yesterday.  I attended my company&#8217;s annual meeting and watched the season premiere of Lost.  At my company&#8217;s annual meeting, we went over lots of exciting things, but there was some concern over our use of Google Apps for our email.  Mainly, that they could glean our IP from reading our email and, should they choose to enter our  market, gain an unfair advantage.  Meanwhile on Lost, the writers actually gave us some insight into the time-travel elements of the show, describing several aspects of time travel that are not typically used in your average time-travel story.  So, what have these two things to do with each other?

I&#8217;d been noodling with a short story centered around time travel, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Travel#Types_of_time_travel">type of time travel</a> I was going to explore is very similar to what was described on Lost.  Close enough that my story would come off as a bit less original than it would have 3 months ago.   Even if my idea isn&#8217;t <b>that</b> original (which ones really are?) it&#8217;s a bit frustrating to see your idea developed (and deployed) by someone else independently.

So, again, what have these to do with each other?  They demonstrate the reality of (and difference between) coming up with an idea and actually doing something with it.  Essentially, and idea, in and of itself, is not particularly valuable.  It&#8217;s what you <b>do</b> with it that really counts.  If Google were to steal my company&#8217;s IP by sniffing our email, I doubt it would have much effect on our ultimate success.  Outside of stealing our code or data outright, our <i>idea</i> isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s hard to come up with.  We just happened to come up with it <b>and execute on it</b> first.  Anyone getting into the game now is necessarily behind us.  Could someone lap us?  Certainly.  Is their ability to do so in any way dependent on know our secret ideas?  I  seriously doubt it.  

So, <b>sitting on ideas is a waste of time</b>.  Trying to hide an idea either for security or for fear of &#8220;unleashing&#8221; it in an underdeveloped state is counter-productive.  <b>Someone else has your idea</b>.  Guaranteed.  And it&#8217;s likely they are developing it.  So, you should be developing it too, and hopefully releasing it to the world, rather than worry about who&#8217;s stealing it, or who came up with it first.  The first to market reaps the rewards.

<time datetime="2009-01-14T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 14<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
<a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/gliffy/tree/master">My command line interface</a> for Gliffy is relatively complete.  It works pretty well, though the error handling isn&#8217;t very clean.  It&#8217;s written in Ruby (<a href="http://davetron5000.github.com/gliffy">RDoc here</a>) and can be used as a Ruby client for Gliffy.</p>
<p>
I decided on Ruby since that would be the most fun and didn&#8217;t require learning a new programming language.  I initially tried to make an ActiveRecord-style domain-based interface, but it was just too difficult and it was hard to see the real benefit.  At the end of the day, I think integrating Gliffy into another application is a relatively simple thing, and a procedural interface would probably be the easiest way to do that.  So, I modeled it after the PHP client library, more or less.
</p>
<p>
The command line interface uses the Ruby client library and provides just the basic functions I need:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='bash'>&amp;gt; gliffy ls
321654 Some Diagram
987654 Some Other Diagram
&amp;gt; gliffy edit 321654
# Takes you to your browser to edit the diagram</code>
  </pre>
</div>

I live on the command line, so this is much more expedient than logging into Gliffy and navigating the UI to edit a diagram.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m already feeling like providing access to the folders via the command line would be helpful (they are exposed in the Ruby client of course).  Not sure how much the API will ultimately change (it&#8217;s in private beta now), but hopefully not too much.  
</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> (explained <a href="http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages">here</a>) is yet <b>another</b> awesome feature of GitHub.  You can publish, via git, arbitrary web content (even piping it through <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master">Jekyll</a> for Textile markup and syntax highlighting).  They have been keeping a tremendous momentum of late; introducing new features on a regular basis.  I hope they keep it up.  GitHub is, IMO, crushing SourceForge and Google Code in terms of simplicity, ease-of-use, and overall functionality.

<a href="http://www.gliffy.com">Gliffy</a> hooked me up with access to the private beta of their API (which I helped design and implement).  I create a  PHP client and experimental MediaWiki plugin to validate the API while working for them, and now I want to get something else going in my spare time.
</p>
<p>
My first thought was to make a Ruby client, because I think it would be fun and relatively easy.  But, I have to admit that a Wordpress plugin would be more useful to me personally.  That being said, A <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> extension would be useful at work, since we are using Trac (which is python based, and I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m too interestedin Python at the moment).  I think if <a href="http://support.github.com/discussions/feature-requests/32-wikis-as-git-repository">GitHub allowed git access to project wikis</a>, it would be cool to allow easier integration of Gliffy diagrams to GitHub project wikis.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, I don&#8217;t have tons of time outside of work, so I want it to be something easily achievable, and also something Chris and Clint are not likely to work on themselves&#8230;.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
So, the &#8220;Ruby way&#8221; is to use underscores to delimit most identifiers, e.g. &#8221;<tt>add_months_to_date</tt>&#8221;, as opposed to the Java camel-case way of &#8221;<tt>addMonthsToDate</tt>&#8221;.  This was initially something that irked me about Ruby, mostly because typing an underscore is kindof a pain (shift with the left hand and pinky with the other).</p>
<p> Now that I&#8217;ve started working, I&#8217;ve been reading a lot of code and realizing that <b>code is more often read than written</b>.  Ultimately, camel case is a just lot harder to read (especially if you create meaningful method names like myself and my co-workers seem to do).
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s pretty hard to defend:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='java'>Date calculatePersonDataUsageHistoryStartDate() {}</code>
  </pre>
</div>

as more readable than:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>def calculate_person_data_usage_history_start_date()
end</code>
  </pre>
</div>

The underscores are like spaces, making the identifier a lot more readable.  Of course, both are more readable than:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='c'>// Calculates the start date of the
// person's data usage history
time_ prsn_dt_uhst_st_dt(){}</code>
  </pre>
</div>

</p>
<p>
This would never fly with Java (and, honestly, look a bit weird), but I&#8217;m no longer gonna curse the Ruby convention.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Though I&#8217;m no longer working for <a href="http://www.gliffy.com">Gliffy</a>, I&#8217;m excited to see that <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/blog/2008/12/08/gliffy-online-release-bpmn-symbols-and-folder-management/">they updated their site</a> with some of what I worked on!  Awesome!
</p>
<p>
Specifically, I worked on the folder organization system that they added to replace the tagging system.  This fell out of the API work that I did (which I&#8217;m assuming is in private beta right now, but I&#8217;m not sure).  I also worked on a feature that, while painful as a developer, is my favorite new thing about Gliffy: the basic account no longer has a five-diagram limit!  That means for free, you can create unlimited diagrams.  The catch is that your diagrams are all public, but I think it&#8217;s a great way to enhance the functionality while subversively getting their name out to more people.
