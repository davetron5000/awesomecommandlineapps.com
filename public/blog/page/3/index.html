  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I had the good fortune to not only attend <a href="http://days2010.scala-lang.org/">ScalaDays 2010</a>, but also to speak (generously supported by <a href="http://www.opower.com">my employer</a>).  The experience overall was great.
I talked to some really enthusiastic and interesting people (including two high school kids from Austria who were using Lift because, after three years of Java, they were tired of it already!)
</p>
<h1>Overall Impressions</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Scala 2.8 has some <b>really</b> powerful new features; I&#8217;m almost <b>glad</b> I don&#8217;t have a significant codebase
    using 2.7, because I would hate to <b>not</b> be able to use 2.8</li>
    <li>The conference had a wide variety of talks, at varying skill levels; this was not a &#8220;beginners-only&#8221; conference, though
    there were plenty of introductory talks (e.g. the <a href="http://akkasource.org/">Akka</a> talk).</li>
    <li>The Scala team seems very interested in moving Scala into industry and changing the perception of it as an &#8220;academic&#8221;
    language (though I&#8217;m not convinced they know what to do, nor should this be their responsibility).</li>
    <li>Most people I talked to who weren&#8217;t using Scala at their jobs were looking at the strategy <a href="http://sneaking-scala.heroku.com/">I had employed</a>
    (using it for better testing), or were just frustrated with not being able to take advantage of Scala&#8217;s productivity.</li>
    <li>Scala&#8217;s flexible syntax and powerful constructs are being used for a very wide variety of things; there were talks
    on using it for <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, parallel collections, and cross-compilation to
    non-standard architectures (i.e. chips with no JVM available).</li>
    <li>The term &#8220;monad&#8221; was mentioned during exactly one talk and not at all for the rest of the conference.  This made
    me feel very good, because the impression I get on the Scala mailing list sometimes is that if you don&#8217;t understand
    mathematical type theory, you are a moron who can never understand Scala.  This impression has been proved false.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Talks I Attended</h2>
<p>
It was very interesting to compare this conference to a <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/home/main">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> conference.  At those, the speakers
are professional, both in that they are getting paid and that they are just, really, really good at speaking and presenting.  Their talks, however, tend to be introductory and not terribly advanced.  I think that&#8217;s fine, these are the type of speakers you want to have when you need to &#8220;get the message out&#8221; on some new and interesting technologies.
</p>
<p>
The speakers at ScalaDays, however, were just regular people using Scala and wanting to talk about it.  As such, things like presentation style and slides were highly varied in terms of quality.  That being said, even the speakers who had the most trouble, still had some interesting things to talk about.  Following are my quick thoughts on each of the talks I attended:
</p>
<h3>Opening Keynote</h3>
<h4>by Martin Odersky</h4>
<p>
His talk was on the new features of Scala 2.8 which, as I said above, are quite exciting.  Package objects, new collections library, and default/named arguments are just some of the highlights.  All-in-all, some very exciting features.
</p>
<h3>Runing Scala in the Browser</h3>
<h4>by Wolfgang Kuehn</h4>
<p>
He had created a way to write Scala code and turn it into JavaScript, much like how GWT does this with Java.  His approach wasn&#8217;t geared around UI widgets, however, but in creating AJAX applications using WebSockets.  I&#8217;ve always felt JavaScript was assembly language (which is why I think <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">coffeescript</a> is so interesting), and this was another way to leverage JavaScript without having to deal with it.
</p>
<h3>Scala Parallel Collections</h3>
<h4>by Aleksander Prokopec</h4>
<p>
This was a preview of a Scala 2.8.1 (or later) feature, where a subpackage of the new 2.8 collections library was created that could perform the collection operations in parallel.  Consider a <tt>filter</tt> on a collection; this is highly parallelizable.  This library is being created to basically implement that in a transparent fashion.  Really interesting stuff.  They had even considered load balancing, via some interesting work-stealing mechanisms.  In only 30 minutes, there wasn&#8217;t a <b>huge</b> amount of detail, but this seems to be another way in which parallel computation could be done very easily.
</p>
<h3>Developing the Scala Bindings to the Fly Object Space</h3>
<h4>by Channing Walton, Nigel Warren, Simon Kent</h4>
<p>
The concept of &#8220;object spaces&#8221; never really sunk in with me, but it wasn&#8217;t actually that relevant to the talk.  This was basically a comparison of a Java library and it&#8217;s straight-port to Scala.  As expected, the Scala implementations were all much more succinct and (to me) clear.  The speakers hadn&#8217;t used a lot of Crazy Scala Magic&#8482; to achieve the real code reduction that was shown.  This talk made it very clear that even if you write &#8220;Java in Scala&#8221;, you still get a lot of productivity gains.
</p>
<h3>CCSTM: Library-based STM for Scala</h3>
<h4>by Nathan Bronson, Hassan Chafi, Kunle Olukotun</h4>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory">Software Transactional Memory</a> is one of the go-to features of Clojure.  Clojure supports it natively, while Scala does not.  This talk was on an implementation of STM as a library for Scala.  It seemed relatively simple to use and understand.  While it&#8217;s not as &#8220;clean&#8221; as the Clojure way of doing things, the speaker made a solid case for a library implementation being a better tradeoff, given the difficulty in adding it to the language at this point in Scala&#8217;s life (it&#8217;s easy to forget how mature the Scala language and compiler are, despite how &#8220;new&#8221; it seems).
</p>
<h3>Lightweight language support for type-based, concurrent event processing</h3>
<h4>by Philipp Haller</h4>
<p>
This talk proposed a function type called &#8220;Translucent Functions&#8221; that were better-suited to concurrency than the partial functions used in the actor library.  Honestly, it was a bit over my head, and I wasn&#8217;t able to catch up with the speaker.  Perhaps the paper would be more elucidating for me.
</p>
<h3>Data Parallel Programming in Scala</h3>
<h4>by Bruce Lester</h4>
<p>
This talk was very similar to the one on Scala Parallel Collections.  Here, the speaker had created a collection library separate from the Scala one, designed specifically to allow parallel processing.  He had a very different approach, using control structures to indicate areas where parallelism could occure.  It was pretty interesting, but the Scala 2.8 Collections Library implementation seemed a lot cleaner to me than this.
</p>
<h3>Type Specialization in Scala</h3>
<h4>by Iulian Drago&#x219;</h4>
<p>
One of the new features of 2.8 is the ability to &#8220;specialize&#8221; your code to work with primitive types and avoid boxing/unboxing.  This is something Java cannot really do.  This talk was an overview of how that worked and what specializations were done to the Scala library.  I guess it&#8217;s nice that this kind of optimization if available, but I think it would have negligible gains for most real-world applications that weren&#8217;t doing constant number crunching.  Even in that case, you don&#8217;t necessarily need this.
</p>
<h3>Leaky Monads</h3>
<h4>by Josh Suereth</h4>
<p>
How could I not attend the only session (and mention!) of Monads?  The speaker gave a good overview of using Monads to
implement automatic resource management (e.g. <code>File.open { |file| file.readlines.whatever }</code>).  The idea was that since Monads are designed to hold onto the objects they manage, it&#8217;s a bit inconvienient when dealing with the results of operating on managed resources.  Thus, his monads &#8220;leaked&#8221; their contents to create more concise code.
</p>
<h3>Type-safe SQL embedded in Scala</h3>
<h4>by Christoph Wulf</h4>
<p>
Akin to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINQ">LINQ</a>, this talk showed how to write SQL directly inside Scala code, but maintain type safety.  It uses
a compiler plugin to achieve this, and he talked a lot about how to tell the difference between embedded SQL and regular Scala code.  I guess the plugin introspects your database to get the types and generates a bunch of code using some Scala classes that get substituted in during compilation.  Pretty interesting.  I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m really <i>missing</i> SQL right in my code, but it is certainly cleaner than JDBC.
</p>
<h3>Scala at LinkedIn: Distribute Computing with Norbert</h3>
<h4>by Chris Conrad</h4>
<p>
This was a talk about how LinkedIn is using Scala to glue together some enabling technologies to create their social network graph.  It seemed really clean and simple, especially since the underlying technologies are all Java-based.  This was mostly an overview of the API and some usage examples.  It&#8217;s <a href="http://sna-projects.com/norbert/">open source</a>, and looks pretty interesting.  I&#8217;m not sure it would be useful for me at my job, but definitely seems like a cool project.
</p>
<h3>Akka</h3>
<h4>by Jonas Boner</h4>
<p>
I was looking forward to this one quite a bit, as akka gets a lot of hype on Twitter.  I think 30 minutes was just too short, as it was pretty light on details.  There was a lot of assertions about Akka that the speakers just didn&#8217;t have time to elucidate or substantiate.  I would love to see a comparison of Scala Actor vs. Akka Actor code and discuss why the Akka way is better.  Similarly, I&#8217;d love to see the basis for all the assertions on Akka&#8217;s performance; it certainly gets a lot of hype.  Jonas is currently working on publicizing the production deployments of Akka (which would go a long way) as well as establishing commercial support for it (which <b>also</b> goes a long way :).
</p>
<h3>Scala IDE for Eclipse</h3>
<h4>by Miles Sabin</h4>
<p>
I went to this purely for my co-workers.  I hate IDEs in general, and Eclipse does some pretty evil things to my co-workers, yet many of them still swear by it.  At any rate, Miles was almost impossible for me to understand (despite being English!) and most of what I got out of the presentation was that Eclipse was very much designed to work with only Java, requiring some nasty hacks to get Scala working with it.  It seems Miles&#8217; Herculean efforts have been used to get around this and there now seems to be a nice development environment for extending and enhancing the Scala plugin.
</p>
<h3>sbt Design and Implementation</h3>
<h4>by Mark Harrah</h4>
<p>
While sbt isn&#8217;t my ideal build tool, but it&#8217;s a billion times better than Maven and Mark&#8217;s talk actually made me appreciate it a lot more.  He is unabashedly in favor of terse symbols over long method names, and he spent some time explaining the rational behind them (thus making things make a bit more sense). His assertion is that you will eventually internalize the symbols and achieve productivity gains at a cost of a slight bump at the start.  I tend to disagree with this, because how often is one modifying their build?  This is why learning and retaining Ant and Maven is so difficult (I can&#8217;t write a <tt>copy</tt> in Ant without a trip to the docs).  At any rate, this was a good talk and great overview of sbt, and, despite me not being into the crazy symbols, I will take it over Maven or Ant any day.  At least it&#8217;s based in a real programming language and not some XML nonsense.
<h3>Processing with Spde</h3>
<h4>by Nathan Hamblen</h4>
<p>
This was a brief over of Processing, for those unfamiliar with this (horribly&#8208;named) visualization tool and then a review of the Scala bindingns the presenter had created.  Interestingly, he created <a href="http://technically.us/spde/About">SPDE</a> as an SBT plugin so that users could gain the benefit of SBT&#8217;s automatic re-compilation and running features.  His plugin + a text editor is a makeshift IDE for Processing, which is pretty cool.  It was very high-level and didn&#8217;t get into too much detail, but the Scala code was, as expected, much more concise than the Java code.
</p>
<h3>Sneaking Scala Into your Organization</h3>
<h4>by Me!</h4>
<p>
I was pretty nervous, as the many of the previous speakers&#8217; topics were all quite heady, but I had practiced my ass off, and delivered the talk as well as I could.  I think it was pretty well received and got some good questions.  I had talked with a few people previously in the conference who were using testing as a way to get Scala into their jobs and a few other people who were interested in what I had to say.  Several people were curious as to how the other developers at OPOWER liked Scala.  I felt pretty good about it.
</p>
<h3>Future of Scala</h3>
<h4>by The Scala Team</h4>
<p>
For this, we broke into small groups and basically unloaded on a poor member of the Scala team as to how anything related to Scala could be better.  Then, the Scala team assembled all of this info while Martin gave a very long term roadmap for Scala.  I do worry that the universe will never catch up to Martin and Scala team as they add more and more advanced and innovative features.
</p>
<p>
After this, a member of the Scala team did a very fast tour of the feedback.  I wish the entire list could be posted; there was a lot of very heartening complaints in there that would not be obvious from the Scala mailing list (e.g.  hate on the underscore, desire to be less academic in terminology)  This fed my (arguably self-biased) impressions that people want to get Scala into industry and that there is a large hole in this part of the Scala universe.
</p>
<p>
There were also some updates on IntelliJ&#8217;s support for Scala.  They sound way ahead of the curve compared to Eclipse and NetBeans, but I was a bit frightened by IDEA&#8217;s  guy saying that they way people learn languages is to ask for auto-completion and see what&#8217;s available.  I see this trend all to often and I think it&#8217;s harmful.  More on that later.
</p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>
Despite still being stuck in Geneva, I&#8217;m glad I went.  Giving my talk was fun, but it was also great to hear about all the many ways in which people are using Scala.  I went in expecting massive academia overload, with a lot of theoretical type system and functional programming talk and got, instead, a wide variety of topics and just the right amount of academia (i.e. not that much).  Really encouraging.  Also encouraging is that ScalaDays 2011 will likely be in the Bay Area, which is a much nicer place to get stuck that stupid Geneva.

      <p class="meta">

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Object-Oriented design is hard, especially in a large application.  It&#8217;s not always clear where logic should go, and there&#8217;s often no &#8220;right place&#8221; to  put a piece of code.  I&#8217;ve found that there are four distinct types of classes that, if you stick to them, can make your code a lot more understandable, and can provide clear direction as to the age-old question of &#8220;where does this code go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<h2>0. Background</h2>
The J2EE way is to have model objects be stupid structs, and have all business logic in a service layer (this is actually very close to a classic &#8220;functional programming&#8221; way of doing things; ironic that many Java devs eschew FP).  Spring lets you do whatever you want, but more or less follows this pattern.  
While the &#8220;Rails Way&#8221; is to put business logic on the model objects, I think the &#8220;service layer&#8221; concept <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/let-them-code-cake/">is eventually going to be common practice</a>.
So, I&#8217;ve found that I very rarely make a pure &#8220;by-the-book according-to-Hoyle&#8221; OO-compliant class; I&#8217;ve settled on four patterns that seem to cover pretty much everything.  I&#8217;ve also noticed that when these patterns get mixed together, you get trouble.
</p>
<p>
<h2>1. The Record</h2>
The <i>record</i> is a dumb struct that you usually need to appease your object-relational mapper.  You may need them elsewhere to just name and type some set of data that you either can&#8217;t model as a tuple because of your language, or don&#8217;t want to model as a tuple because of some complexity.  A record typically has methods that merely expose it&#8217;s contents and often need to be mutable for the reasons stated.  You might have derived fields that are convieniences and not based on your core business logic.  An easy example is a person.  They have a name and a birthdate, and you might derive their age from that:
<script src="http://gist.github.com/319943.js?file=AStruct.java"></script>
</p>
<p>
<h2>2. The Immutable Object</h2>
This is the closest to a pure &#8220;object-oriented&#8221; design.  Classes of this type are immutable and should hold data you will use a lot in your system.  They may also probably have some business-logic attached as methods; this business logic should be entirely focused on the object and its contents.  Typical methods will give you more complex information about the data the object contains, or will vend new objects of the same type, based on the method and parameters called.  
</p>
<p>
This is the most clear distinction (in my mind) between functional programming and object-oriented programming.  In an FP world, the data being operated on would be loosely defined (if at all) and you&#8217;d have functions that transform it.  In an OO world, your object&#8217;s data is clearly defined (by the class fields/accessors), and the operations available are the methods of the class.  When you require that the objects of the class be immutable, you have a very nice encapsulated package of data and operations.  This, to me, seems a lot easier to deal with than a &#8220;module&#8221; of functions and some tuples (or lists of tuples) that the functions operate on.  Scala makes it very easy to create classes like this.  It&#8217;s probably one of the few languages that does so (Java certainly is no help, but it <b>can</b> be done).
<script src="http://gist.github.com/319943.js?file=BObject.java"></script>
</p>
<p>
The benefits here are huge; immutability allows your codebase to be much more comprehensible, and allows you to use these objects in concurrent situations without worry.  Since they are immutable, their methods are immediate targets for caching if you discover you need to do this to improve performance.
</p>
<p>
<h2>3. The Builder</h2>
While you can certainly use methods (or create methods) on Immutable Object classes to &#8220;build up&#8221; the object you want, this is often cumbersome, and results in a lot of object creation for no real reason.  The &#8220;builder&#8221; can be used to make this a bit simpler.  The Builder is a throwaway class whose sole purpose is to create Immutable Objects.  This obviously creates a very tight coupling between the two classes, but this can be worth it.  This is very preferable to a mutable class and, depending on your operating environment, is preferable to making many intermediate objects you will need to create the Immutable Object.
<script src="http://gist.github.com/319943.js?file=CBuilder.java"></script>
</p>
<p>
<h2>4. The Service</h2>
The analog of The Record, the <i>service</i> has no data and all logic.  EJBs are services; they have no internal state, operating on their arguments and returning a result.  Methods of services can be very functional in nature (operating solely on structs or immutable objects), or they may provide functionality that implements complex business logic not logically part of an immutable object&#8217;s class.  In a vanilla n-tier application, you use services to get data in and out of your database (you might call these DAOs and you might distinguish different types of services for partitioning, but these are all the same sort of class).
</p>
<p>
Like records, Services are not OO at all; these are the functions to your C programs structs.  But, there is a good reason for this design; you separate concerns, don&#8217;t need to worry about concurrency (services have no state), and can even horizontally partition <i>where</i> serivces actually run.

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2010-01-26T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 26<span>th</span>, 2010</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Examining the code needed to read a file line by line is a a common way to examine the hoops a programming language makes you jump through.  While Perl certainly
has some one-liners for this, let&#8217;s start with Ruby, which presents an elegant and clear way of doing it:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>File.open(&quot;some_file.txt&quot;) do |file|
  file.readlines.each do |line|
    puts line.upcase
  end
end</code>
  </pre>
</div>

It really doesn&#8217;t get any clearer than that.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s the canonical Java way of doing it, complete with plenty of places to introduce bugs:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='java'>import java.io.*;

public class ReadFile {
  public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {
    File file = new File(&quot;some_file.txt&quot;);
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
      new FileReader(file));
    String line = reader.readLine();
    while (line != null) {
      System.out.println(line.toUpperCase());
      line = reader.readLine();
    }
    reader.close();
  }
}</code>
  </pre>
</div>

Yech.  The need to call <code>readLine()</code> twice kinda sucks.  We could use a do-while, but that requires a second <code>line != null</code> check.  Personally, I like to forget the second <code>readLine()</code> and wonder why my code runs forever :)  That being said, this was extremely easy to figure out, even the very first time I did it in 1998.  The class names are obvious, and the documentation is excellent.
</p>
<p>
Scala to the rescue, right?
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>import scala.io._

object ReadFile extends Application {
  val s = Source.fromFile(&quot;some_file.txt&quot;)
  s.getLines.foreach( (line) =&gt; {
    println(line.trim.toUpperCase)
  })
}</code>
  </pre>
</div>

This was a slight pain figure out.  I looked in <code>scala.io</code> and, of the few classes that were there (including a curiously named <code>BytePickle</code>), it appeared as though <code>Source</code> was the class to use.  Of course, there&#8217;s no easy way to create one from the constructor, and the scaladoc doesn&#8217;t just say &#8220;Dude, look at the <code>Source</code> object&#8221;.  Once I looked through the <code>Source</code> object&#8217;s scaladoc, the solution presented itself.
</p>
<p>
Of course, unlike every other line-traversing library in the known universe, <code>Source</code> leaves the line endings on.  This is thankfully fixed in 2.8 (by which I mean 2.8 breaks 2.7&#8217;s implementation, which is a strange thing for a point release to do).  The real question is: &#8220;Is this how I&#8217;m supposed to read files in Scala?&#8221;.  With a class called <nobr><code>Source?!</code></nobr>.  The scaladoc says that this class represents &#8220;an iterable representation of source files&#8221;.  That might explain the strange methods like <code>reportError</code> and <code>reportWarning</code>.  I guess this is only for writing the Scala compiler?   If so, <code>scala.io</code> seems an odd place to put this.
</p>
<p>
So, my answer is &#8220;No, this <strong>cannot</strong> be how to canonically read files in Scala&#8221;.  Since the Java way kinda, well, sucks, what alternatives are there?  There&#8217;s <code><a href="http://scalax.scalaforge.org/api/">scalax.io</a></code>, which seems to implement this as a class called, curiously, <code>FileExtras</code>.    I&#8217;m not sure if this code is actively maintained, but it&#8217;s documented in classic Scala style: terse and full of loaded terms like &#8220;nonstrict&#8221;. Nevertheless, there seems to be some code here to easily read a file &#8220;the easy way&#8221; (despite some distracting names).
</p>
<p>
This points out a big difference between &#8220;Scala the language&#8221; and &#8220;Scala the library&#8221;.  Scala the language is very interesting and has a lot of potential.  Scala the library is schizophrenic at best; it&#8217;s not sure if it wants to be OO, functional, or what.  The documentation ranges from sparse to absent, and the overall designs of the classes and package range for sublime to baffling.  Years different from Java 1.1.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Got a few questions about how I set up <a href="http://&#10106;&#10144;.ws/">&#10106;&#10144;.ws</a> (which is powered
by <a href="http://www.github.com/davetron5000/shorty">Shorty</a>, my <a href="2009-11-23-good-bad-ugly-scala-url-shortener.html">Scala-based URL shortener</a>), so I thought I&#8217;d write up how I got it working.  Short answer is that it was pretty easy.
</p>
<p>
I got the idea from <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a>, who made a similar thing for his site to post entries on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/daringfireball">@daringfireball</a>.  The trickiest part was figuring out what this was called so I could find out who could sell me a domain with unicode characters in it.
</p>
<p>
It turns out, this is called an IDN (short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">Internationalized Domain Name</a>), and not everyone will sell you one.  Couple that with the need to get a non-<code>.com</code> domain, and I had to hunt around for a while.
</p>
<p>
I ended up going with <a href="http://www.dynadot.com/">DynaDot</a> as they could provide the wacky hostname that I wanted as well as a <code>.ws</code> TLD registration.  I was amazed at the number of domain regstrars whose web forms could not handle Unicode.
It&#8217;s been almost 7 years since <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">Joel Spolsky</a> wrote his screed on dealing with Unicode, so I don&#8217;t know what the deal is.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, the tricky bit in actually <b>using</b> the domain, because a) entering &#10106;&#10144; into vim is nontrivial, and b) I doubt that Apache&#8217;s config file would work with unicode characters in it.  Enter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode">Punycode</a>, which is an asciification of any IDN.  Fortunately, the domain host provides the Punycode for your IDN, so configuring apache was a matter of:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='apache'>&lt;VirtualHost XXXXX&gt;
ServerName xn--dfi5d.ws
ServerAlias www.xn--dfi5d.ws
DocumentRoot /home/webadmin/xn--dfi5d.ws/html
&lt;!-- whatever else goes here --&gt;
JkMount /s* ajp13
JkMount /s ajp13
  &lt;Directory /home/webadmin/xn--dfi5d.ws/html&gt;
    Options Includes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code>
  </pre>
</div>

</p>
<p>
At this point, it pretty much worked, although it was sometimes difficult to get curl to work with the non-punyied name.
</p>
<p>
One thing that was weird was that I found that a <b>lot</b> of domains I wanted to try were taken or not available (with no explanation).  Often it seemed like the punycode version was a normal looking URL that was taken; I tried several IDNs that had a unicode character with a wierd &#8220;5&#8221;, and they punyied to an ascii 5.  Not sure what the deal is there, but I eventually found the one I wanted.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Been working with Spring MVC recently.  My enthusiasm has waned somewhat, as I&#8217;ve discovered that for all of it&#8217;s tweakability and configurableosity, it omits what I believe to be incredibly obvious things:
<ol>
  <li><strong>Simple, 80/20 conventions by default</strong> - While the phrase &#8220;convention over configuration&#8221; appears numerous times
  in the Spring documentation, it is <strong>still</strong> unable to call the <code>foo</code> method of the class
  <code>BarController</code> when I request the url <code>bar/foo</code> without a lot of configuration, some of which subtly conflicts
  and causes silent failures.   The default configuration is useless</li>
  <li><strong>Debugging the Routing</strong> - I shovel angle bracket after annotation after angle bracket into Spring and it simply <strong>can not</strong> tell me what
  URL patterns are mapped to where, and why a given URL isn&#8217;t mapped, nor what to do to get it mapped. It&#8217;s <strong>whole purpose is to map URLs to controllers</strong>.
  Shocking.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple internal routing without magic strings</strong> - If I&#8217;ve mapped <code>FooController</code>&#8217;s <code>bar</code>
  method, shouldn&#8217;t I be able to redirect/route to that in code via <code>route(FooController.class,"bar")</code>, regardless of the specific URL that
  <code>FooController</code> and <code>bar</code> respond to?  Instead, I&#8217;ve got magic strings everywhere and if my urls ever change, god help me.  And don&#8217;t get me 
  started about accessing this stuff via tests.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple web-testing</strong> - Adding a dependency on JWebUnit doesn&#8217;t cut it.  Jetty and Tomcat cannot hot deploy.  How do people test these things??!?!</li>
  <li><strong>Test Fixture Support</strong> - I had to hack this up with DBUnit.  With maven in the mix, it&#8217;s a huge hit to productivity, but at least I have it.  What project <strong>doesn&#8217;t</strong> need this??!?!</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p class="first">
I finally got around to finishing <a href="http://www.github.com/davetron5000/shorty">Shorty</a>, my url-shortener for my vanity short-domain, 
<a href="http://&#10106;&#10144;.ws/">&#10106;&#10144;.ws</a>.  I did the whole thing in Scala as a way to create a fully-functining application
that I would use and that I could finish in my non-work time.  Scala unequivocally made this task enjoyable and quick.  J2EE, on the other hand, 
did not help one bit.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<h3>Scala</h3>
</p>
<p>
My Scala code is so much shorter and easier to follow than the Java equivalent.  Consider this code that, given
the request path, finds a controller to handle it, and then calls the appropriate method based upon
the HTTP method:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>route(path) match {
  case Some(controller) =&gt; {
    val result = determineMethod(request) match {
      case GET =&gt; controller.get(params(request))
      case PUT =&gt; controller.put(params(request))
      case POST =&gt; controller.post(params(request))
      case DELETE =&gt; controller.delete(params(request))
    }</code>
  </pre>
</div>

It&#8217;s highly readable, and very concise; the Java version would&#8217;ve required a lot more variables, some noisier control structures, and a lot more braces and parens.
</p>
<p>
<h3>ScalaTest</h3>
</p>
<p>
ScalaTest resulted in a lot more readable code than JUnit or TestNG would&#8217;ve.  Because of Scala&#8217;s syntax, the tests are also free of weird dots and &#8220;literate&#8221; syntax that
isn&#8217;t quite that literate.
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>it (&quot;should respond to get for a URL that is known&quot;) {
  val controller = new OneUrlController(hasher,&quot;738ddf&quot;)
  val result = controller.get(Map())
  result.getClass should equal (classOf[URL])
  result.asInstanceOf[URL].url should equal 
    (&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;)
}</code>
  </pre>
</div>

The delineation between &#8220;expected&#8221; and &#8220;received&#8221; could not be more clear.  <tt>assertEquals</tt> just isn&#8217;t the same.
The latest version of ScalaTest has some <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_flat_spec">BDD options</a> that look really great.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<h3>SBT</h3>
</p>
<p>
I really wanted to like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/">SBT</a>, and, while it&#8217;s a billion times better than 
<a href="/blog/2009/05/13/why-maven-drives-me-absolutely-batty.html">maven</a>, it&#8217;s still not as easy to use as I&#8217;d like it to be.
</p>
<p>
I like:
<ul>
    <li>Building code and downloading dependencies are separate</li>
    <li>The save/run-tests loop is very handy</li>
    <li>JavaRebel + re-deploying the webapp on file save is very handy</li>
</ul>
However:
<ul>
    <li>The test output is horrid; big huge stack traces</li>
    <li><b>Constant</b> <tt>OutOfMemory</tt> errors that <b>it traps</b> and then <b>doesn&#8217;t exit</b>.  I had to <tt>kill -9</tt> SBT <b>a lot</b></li>
    <li>Still more complicated than shell scripts</li>
</ul>
I believe that a build tool should be a DSL for automating software development tasks, which means it should be more concise and easier to use than UNIX shell scripts.  Ant, Maven, and SBT
fail miserably at this.
</p>
<p>While SBT is light-years ahead by using an actual programming language, I found it very difficult to customize.  Part of this is that the scaladoc tool gives developers <b>no help</b> in documenting their API, but, when it comes down to it, Scala and Java are not system automation languages.
</p>
<h3>scaladoc</h3>
<p>
Scaladoc is nowhere near as powerful as Javadoc.  It makes it very hard to document how to use your code.   Scala should have a <b>more</b> advanced documentation system than Java, but it actually has a much more primitive one; even RDoc is better.  Hopefully, as Scala&#8217;s popularity increases, the tools surrounding it will improve.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Ugly</h2>
<h3>J2EE Deployment</h3>
</p>
<p>
Deployment is an underappreciated aspect of why Rails is so easy to use; copy/push your code to the production server, tell it you are running in production, and go.  With J2EE, you get NONE of this. 
</p>
<p>
If you want to alter configuration based upon environment, you are entirely on your own.  J2EE, Ant, Maven, and SBT give you no real help or support; you have to roll it yourself.  I&#8217;m just shocked at this omission; J2EE is <b>ten years old</b> and <b>still</b> has not provided a solution for something that <b>every</b> project needs.  Amazing.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Servlet Spec</h3>
</p>
<p>
Java 5 is at end of life.  The latest released Servlet Spec <b>still doesn&#8217;t support generics</b> and is <b>still</b> completely schizophrenic about it&#8217;s API (some methods use <tt>Enumeration</tt>, some use arrays, some use <tt>Iterable</tt>.  Ugh).  
</p>
<p>The 3.0 spec looks slightly more sane, but it really doesn&#8217;t do us any favors.  <tt>web.xml</tt> is a trainwreck of stupidity, there&#8217;s zero support for conventions, and the whole thing just feels like a solution designed for a problem that few of us ever have.

  <div class="entry-content"><p class="first">
Following up from my post on <a href="">Deconstructing the map literal in Scala</a>, I thought it might be fun to go the other way around, and create a few literals of own.  Since Scala provides the <i>language features</i> to enable literal-like syntax, and not the actual literals themselves, we can do a lot of stuff to reduce the amount of typing we have to.
</p>
<p>
In your production code, you probably wouldn&#8217;t use a lot of literals, regardless of language support.  However, in test cases, they are much more common.  If creating
objects in your tests becomes easier, you will tend to write better tests.
</p>
<p>
Suppose we are writing a Twitter app (that&#8217;s all the rage these days, anyway).  We might define a <tt>TwitterUser</tt> class like so:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>class TwitterUser(val username:String) {
  def url = &quot;http://www.twitter.com/&quot; + username
  def recentTweets = // imagine some code here 
}</code>
  </pre>
</div>

</p>
<p>
We might write a few test cases:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>val me = new TwitterUser(&quot;davetron5000&quot;)
assertEquals(10,me.recentTweets.size)

val fake = new TwitterUser(&quot;davetron5001&quot;)
assertEquals(0,fake.recentTweets)</code>
  </pre>
</div>

and so forth.  It&#8217;s going to get a bit tedious writing <tt>new TwitterUser</tt> over and over again.  We could just make a shorter-named method in our test class, but why not use <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ScalaBasics#Literals_and_Syntactic_Sugar">the <tt>apply()</tt> sugar</a> along with a <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ScalaObject">singleton object</a> to make our own literal?
</p>
<p>
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>// Along with our TwitterUser class def
object @@ { // &quot;@&quot; is a reserved word :(
  def apply(username:String) = new TwitterUser(username)
}

// back to our test code

val me = @@(&quot;davetron5000&quot;)
val fake = @@(&quot;davetron5001&quot;)</code>
  </pre>
</div>

</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s a small bit of code, and we&#8217;ve saved some typing without sacrificing readability, since we take advantage of the way Twitter refers to users via the &#8220;@&#8221; symbol.
</p>
<p>
If our app is all about Twitter, we can go a step further and just rename <tt>TwitterUser</tt> to <tt>@@</tt> like so:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>// This replaces the TwitterUser class 
// and @@ singleton object
case class @@(val username:String) {
  def url = &quot;http://www.twitter.com/&quot; + username
}</code>
  </pre>
</div>

This takes advantage of (the unfortunately named) <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/CaseClasses">case classes</a> and now our Twitter user class <b>and</b> literal-like factory are called <tt>@@</tt>.  This allows, among other things, some more readable case statements.
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>user match {
  case @@(&quot;davetron5000&quot;) =&gt; &quot;it's you, dude&quot;
  case user:@@ =&gt; &quot;it's someone else&quot;
}</code>
  </pre>
</div>

</p>
<p>
Now, you certainly don&#8217;t want to do this for every object in your domain (you&#8217;d get a horrible mess of symbols), but for key objects that you are using everywhere, an appropriately chosen literal syntax can make your code very clean and easy to read and modify.

  <div class="entry-content"><p class="first">
I find that Scala is one giant <a href="">Rube Goldberg Machine</a> that manages to do something not easily be done otherwise.  By this I mean that Scala has many features that, by themselves, seem very strange, but, in combination, enable some very cool functionality.  This is why I initially started my <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour">personal tour of Scala</a>.  I read stuff like <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ExplcitlyTypedSelfReferences">explicitly typed self-references</a> and was left scratching my head.
</p>
<p>
I thought it might be fun to deconstruct the &#8220;map literal&#8221; in Scala and observie how the features interact to create a very handy piece of code that isn&#8217;t baked into the language.  This assumes and understanding of some <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ScalaBasics">Scala basics</a>.
</p>
<p>
Although Java 7 is getting map literals, Scala already has it (or so it appears):

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>val band = Map(&quot;Dave&quot; -&gt; &quot;Bass&quot;,
                &quot;Tony&quot; -&gt; &quot;Guitar&quot;,
                &quot;Greg&quot; -&gt; &quot;Drums&quot;)</code>
  </pre>
</div>

This is not actually a literal, but enabled by Scala features to make it look like a literal.  Which means that you can use these facilities to make your own literals.  So, how does this work?
</p>
<p>
Most surprising to a Java programmer is the <tt>-&gt;</tt> operator.  This makes use of two Scala features:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ScalaOperators">Operator-like method naming</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ImplicitConversions">Implicit Conversions</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the <tt>-&gt;</tt> operator is on the class <tt>Predef.ArrowAssoc</tt>.  <tt>Predef</tt> is automatically imported in every Scala program, so you don&#8217;t need to prefix anything with <tt>Predef</tt>.  It returns a tuple of its caller and its argument, e.g.
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>val dave = new ArrowAssoc(&quot;Dave&quot;)
val entry = dave -&gt; &quot;Bass&quot;
// entry is now (&quot;Dave&quot;,&quot;Bass&quot;)
// which is a Tuple2[String,String]</code>
  </pre>
</div>

</p>
<p>
Of course, we aren&#8217;t creating <tt>ArrowAssoc</tt> instances anywhere, so how does this get called?  This is where implicits come in.  Suppose we change our simple example to:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>val dave = &quot;Dave&quot;
val entry = dave -&gt; &quot;Bass&quot;
// entry is still (&quot;Dave&quot;,&quot;Bass&quot;)
// which is a Tuple2[String,String]</code>
  </pre>
</div>

Here, Scala sees that the method <tt>-&gt;</tt> needs to be called on an <tt>ArrowAssoc</tt>, but is being called on a <tt>String</tt>.  Instead of giving up, Scala notices the method: 
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>implicit def any2ArrowAssoc[A](x: A): 
  ArrowAssoc[A] = new ArrowAssoc(x)</code>
  </pre>
</div>

This means that anything at all can be converted into an <tt>ArrowAssoc</tt> if there&#8217;s some reason to.  And we have a reason to here.
</p>
<p>
This means our code is now effectively:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>val band = Map((&quot;Dave&quot; , &quot;Bass&quot;),
                (&quot;Tony&quot; , &quot;Guitar&quot;),
                (&quot;Greg&quot; , &quot;Drums&quot;))</code>
  </pre>
</div>

It&#8217;s not hard to imagine a <tt>Map</tt> constructor taking <tt>Tuple2</tt>, using the first part as the key and the second part as the value, however where is the constructor?  Scala creates objects via the <tt>new</tt> keyword, just as Java does.  So, what&#8217;s going on here?
</p>
<p>
This use two additional Scala features:
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ScalaBasics#Literals_and_Syntactic_Sugar"><tt>apply()</tt>
        shortcutting</a>
    <li><a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ScalaObject">Scala singleton objects</a></li>
</ol>
This is much simpler to decode than the <tt>-&gt;</tt> method; there is simply an object in scope named <tt>Map</tt>, and it has an <tt>apply</tt> method that takes a variable list of <tt>Tuple2</tt> objects.  Scala interprets a method-call syntax on an object, but lacking a method name, as a call to the <tt>apply</tt> method of that object (if it exists).  So, removing this, we have:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='scala'>val band = Map.apply((&quot;Dave&quot; , &quot;Bass&quot;),
                      (&quot;Tony&quot; , &quot;Guitar&quot;),
                      (&quot;Greg&quot; , &quot;Drums&quot;))</code>
  </pre>
</div>

</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s all there is to it!  A few things to note about this:
<ul>
    <li>Without the application of some Scala features, it&#8217;s pretty ugly</li>
    <li>The language itself didn&#8217;t need to implement a special &#8220;map literal&#8221;; it simply combines smaller features
    in a way to make it appear as though it does.  You can even create your own &#8220;literals&#8221; rather than waiting for
    the language to implement them</li>
</ul>
</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p class="first">
One thing I love about Github is that they open-source a <b>lot</b> of their internal tools that power the site.  What&#8217;s interesting is that, unlike SourceForge, they open source little bits and pieces; tiny libraries that do one specific thing.  These things are supremely useful (I use <a href="http://www.github.com/davetron5000/grit">Grit</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> quite often).
</p>
<p>This is a huge benefit to them; their products become higher-quality through contribution, and their talent-pool increases due to their contribution to the community; they are positioned as a technical leader and social force in the development community.  I&#8217;ve often wondered why more companies don&#8217;t do this and what&#8217;s really involved?
</p>
<p>
There are three main hurdles to overcome in order to do this:
<ul>
    <li><b>Usefulness</b> - do you have code that someone will find useful?</li>
    <li><b>Legalish</b> - are you comfortable giving away some part of your company&#8217;s intellectual property?</li>
    <li><b>Technical</b> - does your technical infrastructure support extraction, collaboration, and re-integration?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Usefulness</h3>
I think comparing Github to Sourceforge makes this point very clear.  While SourceForge does <b>more</b> than, say, <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/bert">BERT</a>, it&#8217;s just a big huge all-or-nothing proposition; Github has extracted small parts of their infrastructure useful outside the realm of &#8220;software project hosting&#8221;, resulting in many useful, fine-grained libraries.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Legalish</h3>
The issue here is essentially to determine if the gains achieved by open-sourcing some of your code are <i>greater</i> than the competitive advantage <i>lost</i> by doing so.  Again, the ability to extract small, focused, and useful pieces of functionality is key.  Github isn&#8217;t open-sourcing their entire infrastructure; just the parts that are really useful and not incidental to their success (though one may argue that their IP has <b>nothing</b> to do with their success).
</p>
<p>
<h3>Technical</h3>
Here&#8217;s where things get interesting.  Extracting a small, useful piece of technology from your application, without revealing any trade secrets or other IP can be a challenging task.  Add to that the infrastructure needed to manage and incorporate contributions, and your technical infrastructure could be the main barrier to interacting with the community (and <b>not</b> the lawyers!).
</p>
<p>
My company struggles with this daily, as our tools were just not designed to make extraction and management of dependencies easy.  Our problem is almost entirely based on tooling and technology choice (which I&#8217;ll get into in a further post).
</p>
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
The advantages to open-sourcing some of your code are obvious: you can improve the quality of your codebase while improving your standing in the community (which enahnces your ability to attract top-talent).  You just need to make sure your technical infrastructure is built for it, and that the lines of communication between the development staff and the legal staff are clear and functional.
</p>
<p>
That Github routinely open-sources bits of their code speaks volumes to the choices they&#8217;ve made as an organization, as well as their technical prowess.
