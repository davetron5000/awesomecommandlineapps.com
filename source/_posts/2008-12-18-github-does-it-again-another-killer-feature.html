<p><a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> (explained <a href="http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages">here</a>) is yet <b>another</b> awesome feature of GitHub.  You can publish, via git, arbitrary web content (even piping it through <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master">Jekyll</a> for Textile markup and syntax highlighting).  They have been keeping a tremendous momentum of late; introducing new features on a regular basis.  I hope they keep it up.  GitHub is, IMO, crushing SourceForge and Google Code in terms of simplicity, ease-of-use, and overall functionality.
