<b>Me:</b> The Gliffy API is RESTFul<br />
<b>REST Compliance Officer:</b> Does a "PUT" update the data at the given URL?<br />
<b>Me:</b> Yes.<br />
<b>RCO:</b> Trick Question!  It's "URI".  Is the only way to create a new resource done with a "POST"?<br />
<b>Me:</b> Yes.<br />
<b>RCO:</b> Is there exactly one endpoint, from which any and all resource locators are discoverable?<br />
<b>Me:</b> Um, no, that puts undue burden on the client libraries, and over-complicates what we were trying to accomp....<br />
<b>RCO:</b> <i>YOU ARE NOT RESTFUL!  READ FIELDING'S DISSERTATION, THE HTTP SPEC AND IMPLEMENT AN RFC-COMPLIANT URI  PARSER IN THREE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.  NEXT!</i>

P.S. If you are going to coin a term and you want to <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">bitch about it being misused</a>, maybe calling it a "style" isn't the best idea.
