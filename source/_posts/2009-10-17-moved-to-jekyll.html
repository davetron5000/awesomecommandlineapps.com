title: Moved my blog to Jekyll
layout: post

<p>
Kinda wanted a change of pace, so I moved my website over to <a href="http://www.github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, which has been fun to set up.  Plus, I actually spent more than 10 seconds on a site design.  I'm assuming my many hours of labour could've been done by a real designer.

At any rate, Jekyll seems reasonably easy to deal with.  I got a very small taste of Capistrano as well; I push my site to a remote bare git repo on this server and then have the capfile update it.  I suppose it could be more sophisticiated, but this seems to work for now.
