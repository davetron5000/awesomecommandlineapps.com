title: Why underscores might be better than camel case

So, the "Ruby way" is to use underscores to delimit most identifiers, e.g. "<tt>add_months_to_date</tt>", as opposed to the Java camel-case way of "<tt>addMonthsToDate</tt>".  This was initially something that irked me about Ruby, mostly because typing an underscore is kindof a pain (shift with the left hand and pinky with the other).</p>
<p> Now that I've started working, I've been reading a lot of code and realizing that <b>code is more often read than written</b>.  Ultimately, camel case is a just lot harder to read (especially if you create meaningful method names like myself and my co-workers seem to do).

It's pretty hard to defend:
{% highlight java %}
Date calculatePersonDataUsageHistoryStartDate() {}
{% endhighlight %}
as more readable than:
{% highlight ruby %}
def calculate_person_data_usage_history_start_date()
end
{% endhighlight %}
The underscores are like spaces, making the identifier a lot more readable.  Of course, both are more readable than:
{% highlight c %}
// Calculates the start date of the
// person's data usage history
time_ prsn_dt_uhst_st_dt(){}
{% endhighlight %}
</p>
<p>
This would never fly with Java (and, honestly, look a bit weird), but I'm no longer gonna curse the Ruby convention.
