While packaging <a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/daves-resume">my resume</a> creator/formatter as a Ruby Gem, I noticed my command line parser was preventing my code from running.  It has this hook that sets up an "auto run" sequence (your code just defines a <tt>main</tt> method):
{% highlight ruby %}
def self.inherited(child_class)
  @@appname = caller[0][/.*:/][0..-2]
  @@child_class = child_class
  if @@appname == $0
    __set_auto_run
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
the problem is that <tt>$0</tt> from gem is the <tt>/usr/bin</tt> location and <tt>@@appname</tt> is the <b>actual</b> location in the Gem repository.  Not sure why this check was there, but I had a problem.
</p>
<p>
Not feeling like overhauling the command line interface code and not being able to patch OptionParser, I opted instead to use the dangerous-sounding ruby feature of <i>replacing the method with my own implementation</i>:
{% highlight ruby %}
class CommandLine::Application
  class << self
    alias old_inherited inherited

    def inherited(child_class)
      @@appname = caller[0][/.*:/][0..-2]
      @@child_class = child_class
      normalized_appname = @@appname.gsub(/^.*\//,"");
      normalized_dollar0 = $0.gsub(/^.*\//,"");
      if normalized_appname == normalized_dollar0
        __set_auto_run
      end
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
Now <b>that's</b> pretty cool.  My code just dynamically patches the broken Gem!  The power of open source and dynamic languages.  Of course, this feature allows so much awful code to be written....
