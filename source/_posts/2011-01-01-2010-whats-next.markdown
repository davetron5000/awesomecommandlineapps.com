title: 2010 in review; what's next for me in 2011

Yesterday, while waiting for guests to arrive at my mostly-annual New Year's Eve party, I found a txt file I created called `2010_goals.txt`.  It's contents:

* speak at at least one more user's group
* speak at some sort of conference
* deploy an App to the iPhone App Store
* Deploy a Rails 2 app to Heroku

<!-- more -->
I had totally forgotten about this, although I accomplished almost everything on that list.  This year, I spoke at [DCRUG][dcrug] twice, [NOVAJUG][novajug] once, and [spoke at ScalaDays][scaladays] 2010 in Switzerland (and was subsequently trapped by that [stupid volcano][volcano]) as well as [Lone Star Ruby Conf][lsrc] in Austin.  While I still haven't quite submitted [my iPhone app][winebrain] to the app store, I *did* deploy a Rails _three_ app to heroku, namely my Rails Rumble '10 entry [Carl The Robot][carl].   On top of all that, I successfully completed [PragProWriMo][pragprowrimo], writing a 170+ page book on command-line applications in Ruby in just one month.  *And* had [more][patch1] [than][patch2] [a few][patch3] [patches][patch4] [accepted][patch5] [to some][patch6] [open source][scala] [projects][showoff].

So, I created `2011_goals.txt` to continue the tradition:

* Deploy my iPhone app to App Store
* Speak at at least 2 conferences
* Publish my command-line application book
* Develop and deploy an iPad app
* Blog twice a month
* Learn JavaScript more betterer
* Get my rudimentary [scaladoc doclet][doclet] accepted.

I think it's doable, but I've got a busy year planned in the non-geek-related parts of my life, so who knows?  What are *your* goals for 2011?
