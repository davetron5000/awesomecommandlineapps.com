I love <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com">this thing, it's a </a><a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> hack that allows you to plot a course, with waypoints, and show you the distance as well as mile markers.  I've been using it to plot different paths for running specific distances.  You can even save the path for later viewing.  <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=263601">Here's</a> a course I ran the other day for a three mile run.
