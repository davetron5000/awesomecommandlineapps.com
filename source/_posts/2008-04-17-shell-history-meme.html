In response to the rage-of-the-moment <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/history_meme">shell history</a> meme, I present my list, which looks different than a lot of peoples':
<ul>
<li><b>149</b><tt> cd</tt> - Well, duh</li>
<li><b>104</b><tt> ./run.sh</tt> - Occasionally to run JBoss (I have to have two JBoss servers running locally, and when I do a complete recompile/redeploy (not often), I must restart, as ant fstats the ever-loving shit out thousands of files (multiple times, per, 'natch, cause it so superior to <tt>make</tt>) at the same time JBoss is hot-deploying (twice) and my machine just dies), but more often to run the application I'm developing.</li>
<li><b>88</b><tt> tail</tt> - To read log files (were I on OS X, Console.app would be the way to go)</li>
<li><b>84</b><tt> ls</tt> - Well, duh</li>
<li><b>73</b><tt> git</tt> - I <code>commit</code> a lot, I <code>diff</code> alot, I <code>stat</code> alot, and I <code>blame</code> alot.  <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/daveblog5000/?p=32">You should, too</a></li>
<li><b>57</b><tt> sqlshell.pl</tt> - Awesomely awesome command-line SQL client written by my co-worker and enhanced on occasion by me.  I'll probably steal it when I leave this project, and I wish he'd put it up on sourceforge</li>
<li><b>51</b><tt> jobs</tt> - To find out which JBosses to kill (frequently executed in the wrong shell window)</li>
<li><b>44</b><tt> kill</tt> - To then go kill JBoss</li>
<li><b>43</b><tt> vi</tt> - To get some work done</li>
</ul>
