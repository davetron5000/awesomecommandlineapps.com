title: Writing a URL Shortener in Scala - The Good, The Bad, The Ugly
layout: post
---
<p class="first">
I finally got around to finishing <a href="http://www.github.com/davetron5000/shorty">Shorty</a>, my url-shortener for my vanity short-domain, 
<a href="http://&#10106;&#10144;.ws/">&#10106;&#10144;.ws</a>.  I did the whole thing in Scala as a way to create a fully-functining application
that I would use and that I could finish in my non-work time.  Scala unequivocally made this task enjoyable and quick.  J2EE, on the other hand, 
did not help one bit.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<h3>Scala</h3>
</p>
<p>
My Scala code is so much shorter and easier to follow than the Java equivalent.  Consider this code that, given
the request path, finds a controller to handle it, and then calls the appropriate method based upon
the HTTP method:
{% highlight scala %}
route(path) match {
  case Some(controller) => {
    val result = determineMethod(request) match {
      case GET => controller.get(params(request))
      case PUT => controller.put(params(request))
      case POST => controller.post(params(request))
      case DELETE => controller.delete(params(request))
    }
{% endhighlight %}
It's highly readable, and very concise; the Java version would've required a lot more variables, some noisier control structures, and a lot more braces and parens.
</p>
<p>
<h3>ScalaTest</h3>
</p>
<p>
ScalaTest resulted in a lot more readable code than JUnit or TestNG would've.  Because of Scala's syntax, the tests are also free of weird dots and "literate" syntax that
isn't quite that literate.
{% highlight scala %}
it ("should respond to get for a URL that is known") {
  val controller = new OneUrlController(hasher,"738ddf")
  val result = controller.get(Map())
  result.getClass should equal (classOf[URL])
  result.asInstanceOf[URL].url should equal 
    ("http://www.google.com")
}
{% endhighlight %}
The delineation between "expected" and "received" could not be more clear.  <tt>assertEquals</tt> just isn't the same.
The latest version of ScalaTest has some <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_flat_spec">BDD options</a> that look really great.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<h3>SBT</h3>
</p>
<p>
I really wanted to like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/">SBT</a>, and, while it's a billion times better than 
<a href="/blog/2009/05/13/why-maven-drives-me-absolutely-batty.html">maven</a>, it's still not as easy to use as I'd like it to be.
</p>
<p>
I like:
<ul>
    <li>Building code and downloading dependencies are separate</li>
    <li>The save/run-tests loop is very handy</li>
    <li>JavaRebel + re-deploying the webapp on file save is very handy</li>
</ul>
However:
<ul>
    <li>The test output is horrid; big huge stack traces</li>
    <li><b>Constant</b> <tt>OutOfMemory</tt> errors that <b>it traps</b> and then <b>doesn't exit</b>.  I had to <tt>kill -9</tt> SBT <b>a lot</b></li>
    <li>Still more complicated than shell scripts</li>
</ul>
I believe that a build tool should be a DSL for automating software development tasks, which means it should be more concise and easier to use than UNIX shell scripts.  Ant, Maven, and SBT
fail miserably at this.
</p>
<p>While SBT is light-years ahead by using an actual programming language, I found it very difficult to customize.  Part of this is that the scaladoc tool gives developers <b>no help</b> in documenting their API, but, when it comes down to it, Scala and Java are not system automation languages.
</p>
<h3>scaladoc</h3>
<p>
Scaladoc is nowhere near as powerful as Javadoc.  It makes it very hard to document how to use your code.   Scala should have a <b>more</b> advanced documentation system than Java, but it actually has a much more primitive one; even RDoc is better.  Hopefully, as Scala's popularity increases, the tools surrounding it will improve.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Ugly</h2>
<h3>J2EE Deployment</h3>
</p>
<p>
Deployment is an underappreciated aspect of why Rails is so easy to use; copy/push your code to the production server, tell it you are running in production, and go.  With J2EE, you get NONE of this. 
</p>
<p>
If you want to alter configuration based upon environment, you are entirely on your own.  J2EE, Ant, Maven, and SBT give you no real help or support; you have to roll it yourself.  I'm just shocked at this omission; J2EE is <b>ten years old</b> and <b>still</b> has not provided a solution for something that <b>every</b> project needs.  Amazing.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Servlet Spec</h3>
</p>
<p>
Java 5 is at end of life.  The latest released Servlet Spec <b>still doesn't support generics</b> and is <b>still</b> completely schizophrenic about it's API (some methods use <tt>Enumeration</tt>, some use arrays, some use <tt>Iterable</tt>.  Ugh).  
</p>
<p>The 3.0 spec looks slightly more sane, but it really doesn't do us any favors.  <tt>web.xml</tt> is a trainwreck of stupidity, there's zero support for conventions, and the whole thing just feels like a solution designed for a problem that few of us ever have.
</p>
