### Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby
#### Control your Computer, Simplify your Life

Woot!

[My Book][book] is in Beta!  Whoohoo!  It's all about writing amazing command-line apps in Ruby.  This isn't about hacking
together UNIX commands, or bash scriptingâ€¦this is about making apps that are easy to learn, easy to use, easy to write, and
that will delight their users.  Seriously, stop making crappy command-line scripts, read my book, and start kicking ass.

It's been a **long** time coming.  Please stop now, and go [check it out][book].  I started this almost a year ago during
[PragProWriMo][pragprowrimo], where I wrote (almost) every single day in November of 2010.  When I saw that [Travis
Swicegood][travis] (one of the few who made it all the way through) had gotten his manuscript accepted, I cleaned up a chapter
and submitted and the [Prags][prags] accepted!

I've spent my time since then writing, re-writing, re-organizing, and working hard to get this thing done.  It's in beta,
meaning that you can buy the e-book and read the work in progress.  It's *almost* complete, just a few chapters to go, and by
reading it in beta, you can give me valuable feedback to make the book even better.

[Check it out][book] now!
