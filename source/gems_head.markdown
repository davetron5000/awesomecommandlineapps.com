One of the toughest things about writing command-line apps in Ruby is finding the right gems.  There's tons out there, but they
can be really hard to find, either due to names that are too generic (main) or too bizzare (trollop).  Searching on RubyGems and
Github is OK, but not great.  While speaking at conferences and writing the book, I came across a ton of wonderful
gems for writing command-line apps.  This page is an attempt to catalog them all.
