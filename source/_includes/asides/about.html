  I'm a veteran professional software developer who spends most of my time on the command line. I speak frequently at national and regional conferences and spend my days as a developer for LivingSocial in Washington, DC.
  I've written applications in C, C++, Perl, Ruby, Scala, and many others, always using the command line in some form or other.
  As a developer, I believe in clean code, doing it right, providing a great user experience and using the right tool for the job.
